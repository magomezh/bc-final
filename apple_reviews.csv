We’re a family of Apple products. Just like the simplicity of the iOS system. Never had any issues with any of their phones nor did I expect too if I’m honest.  I did try a Samsung once but sent it back, it just didn’t have the same smoothness of the operating system. That was important to me.

Ordered a Mac mini that when hooked to my Samsung 4K tv would work fine then the screen would turn black then come back on. Called talked to the tech guy and with no run around we both agreed it must be a defective graphics card. He suggested I request a replacement which I did.  Was on the phone a total of 10 minutes between the tech and sales guys. I received the defective unit on Tuesday shipped it back to Apple on Wednesday and received my brand new flawless Mac mini on Friday. Completely amazed at the speed at which they work. Thank you to all involved in resolving my issue so fast. I’m amazed. They even shipped the replacement before they received my return. And I can tell you coming from a 2012 Mac mini to the new model I am completely amazed. It wasn’t cheap but it is well worth the money. Side note I just upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 11 and once again I was blown away.  Have never been disappointed with any of my apple products or the price for what you get.

I have never been a fan of Apple. But when I bought MacBook it was a blessing! It you use note for a work, not simple browsing and movie watching, but working, there is no better thing than MacBook. Touchpad and operation system is WOW so good. Not a fan of iPhone because they are too expensive and difference with android is not so great

Well January 17 my lockout!! I had got so use to using Touch ID that once my phone went dead I was stuck I couldn’t even remember the password. So I to contact apple support by phone was told to follow steps to recovery on top of that I had no idea what my Apple ID password was once again to use to using Touch ID. Long story short apple security is the best I must say that. I had so many steps to do, just to be able to get into my iphone. Thank God for iCloud for much was saved!  I called apple once on the 17 and all other contact was email the iTunes recovery steps didn’t seem simple at 1st however once I plugged her up to a desktop it was all she wrote today is the 21 my phone is backup and running. I say that was pretty good being the error codes I was getting was right there on the support site. So I knew it was my computer or wire. Today I called in for once I was able to get into my phone I ended up getting stuck the rep was able to help me and I’m now looking at my children’s videos&amp; pictures I had backed up thanking all  representatives who helped me. The security is awesome now how do I get ringtones lol

I had an Iphone 5 that started having troubles this past December 2019.  I finally got a chance to bring it in in January.  I was 5 minutes late for my appoint due to parking.  They cancelled my appoint and said I had to wait a week to schedule another one.  I work 65 miles away, and the only time I could take it in was on weekends.   After enough complaining (remember not more than 5 minutes late) they agreed to fit me in.  Two hours later, right at closing they said it was a bad battery and because they could not remove it, they would give new a refurbished Iphone 5 for just sigh of $60.00.  Well, this refurbish IPhone  lasted 2 months before the screen started getting verticle black and white lines across it and shut off  completely.   I called Apple.  The lady was very nice and agreed that it should have lasted longer than 2 months.  She said Apple would send me a replacement Iphone 5 for free, and that I wouldn't have to leave a credit card.  3 weeks later, the same lady calls me and couldn't be slower saying she made a mistake in writing up the order.   Today (May 7, 2020) I receive an email saying only 2 days left to save the order.  I entered my info and on the next page Ap[ple wanted to charge my credit card for $490.50!    I have a brother and a cousin dying from cancer. and depending on me for help.   I work 65 miles from home.  And these P** leave me hanging for over a month and now want $490.50 from me, for a product they sold me 3 months ago?????????????   Android!

When a company doesn't let you use a phone that you bought outright without their apple id, or their customer rep speaks very poor English, or when they take over a month to send out a password recovery email....well...that tells you everything you need to know about apple customer service.

I recently decided to change my Apple ID password. More fool me. When I did this, I kept being prompted to change the password multiple times, until I forgot my previous password and was stuck. Naturally with COVID-19 situation and Apple Stores in OZ closed, I could not get immediate help. I had to wait 5 days until I got a message that I could change my Apple ID - which was successful despite their incorrect step-by-step instructions. Since yesterday, I have been prompted to enter my new Apple ID on different devices MULTIPLE times to ensure all apps can be accessed. Just wondering how many times (and days) I have to keep re-entering my password as it is totally tiresome. I also cannot access my older version Apple TV without entering password every time I want to use Apple TV Plus. I so wish I had switched to Android devices last year as Apple is no where near the user friendliness and compatibility I want these days.

I’m using iPhone XS with THREE provider. Nothing works good since October 2019. I’m not sure what causes the issues. It looks like them both are not compatible.  My device doesn’t do essential things most of the time. At my household there are another iPhones, 7 and XS MAX. Only the old 7 on GiffGaff works well. XS MAX struggle as much as XS with THREE. White screen instead web contain. Browsing takes ages and so many times it ends as safari couldn’t open the page. I’m paying £60 a month to having unlimited data. What do I get, frustrations. Can you imagine if you are online banking and your screen goes blank. And lots of other situations when I need to things now. Not when iPhone decides to work.  To help it work everyday numbers of switch off/on, fly mode on/off. Also technical support advice from THREE to clear safari browser history and reset network settings. I feel extremely disappointed. I’ve been happy iPhone user since 2007. Probably not anymore.

2019/2020 MacBook Pro’s are very poorly made.  They had to replace mine as it went wrong within weeks of purchase.  Took nearly a year for apple to rectify and only then after legal proceedings were commenced.  And yes I did have Apple Care Plus.

Absolutely fuming with Apple . Ive been a customer for over 10 years , we have 4 children , 2 of whom are young adults . So over The years we’ve had a lot of devices , currently have 4 iPads and 5 iPhones in the house that have cost us a considerable amount over the years and only sent off for a repair once which was about 4 years ago .  My sons iPhone XR has frozen and can not swipe the screen at all and is less than a year old. I sent it off for repair only to of got a message today saying I need to pay £350 . I decided to call them and spoke to a lady who was very polite and said They have to charge me as it has a small crack at the back of the phone . I told them I wasn’t bothered about the crack as it’s never affected the phone and don’t want that repairing just the system fault . She put me thru to a senior member of the team and he was very rude . Didn’t want to listen . Told me they can’t fix it without fixing the crack and that would cost me £350 !  Absolute joke .  Wasn’t interested in anything I had to say . I just expected more from this company ! The amount of money they make. I understand the small crack was my sons fault but it’s never had an affect on the phone and the fault isn’t through that ana is a system fault . They don’t want to charge me for the system fault but won’t fix that without me paying for a new back at a cost of £350 ! Just very rude customer service and pretended he couldn’t even hear me by the end of it and put the phone down on me

I bought a new device in Nov 2019 through Vodafone.  I was never told by Apple or Vodafone about the 1 year free Apple TV promotion . I found out about it a week ago by a friend and then attempted to access it.  After over an hour on the phone with Apple I was told I could no longer get it due to it expiring 90 days after purchase. They would not budge - this is disgusting and so disappointing - whether it’s worth having or not - it’s the principle - they are really pathetic - customer service?

I am extremely frustrated with Apple and their ‘services’ as I had bought one of their iPhone XS devices BRAND NEW for $1,600, 8 months ago and it no longer charges via lightning cable as the charging port no longer works. I have called them and asked for my options but being currently closed due to covid-19 Apple said my options were limited. I can either ship the device to them for it to get assessed then POTENTIALLY fixed then sent back which could take around a month depending on shipping which I explained I couldn’t do that as i’m an essential worker in this pandemic. Their response to this is “they couldn’t give me a phone to use in the meantime while that process is being done”. My second option was to call and book an appointment with one of their Apple authorised businesses that are still operating to have them look at it - then get back to apple with the issue, to then either fix it at no charge or if the issue being my fault - I pay for it. I was also told it could be caused by using too many different cables which would make the damage my fault so I then have to pay for it. The following day I then called the most local Apple authorised business being 45 minutes from where I live and they then told me that they’re booked out for the next 3 weeks and I have to call weekly to attempt to make a booking - which is almost impossible as they don’t answer the phone and don’t respond to emails. I then asked when’s the best time to call and when do they open the bookings for the next week and they couldn’t give me a day or time expecting me to call daily to get a booking and even if I got the chance to make a booking i’m currently working 6 day weeks from 6am to 4pm as an essential worker and the Apple authorised business closes at 5pm and is not open weekends; making my chances near impossible. I then called back Apple explaining that the two options they had given me weren’t good enough as with covid-19 I’m an essential service working Monday through to Saturday and my phone doesn’t charge. They’ve told me they essentially could not care less. After hours and days of fighting the best option they could come up with was me paying $40 out of pocket, to send in my phone and be without a phone for days and have them return me a MANUFACTURED PHONE - not even a brand new phone!!! I am extremely disgusted that Apple is a multi-billion dollar corporation and they can’t even 1) spare a new phone for a customer who spent thousands on the phone that is STILL UNDER WARRANTY &amp; 2) help out an essential worker who is risking their life to service Australia. Honestly considering spending my money elsewhere from now on and you should too - this isn’t how a successful business should treat their loyal and paying customers - pandemic or not they weren’t going to help me either way. Apple needs to be boycotted.

I used to be a loyal customer. I am very disappointed by Apple product quality and poor customer service. My son accidentally bought Apple music service when he played a word game. I cancelled the purchase on the second when I saw the charge and contacted Apple customer service. They refused to refund for a subscription (cancelled within 24 hours and never used the service). Then I realized that Apple ID didn't work appropriately. I found my phone coul turn on by different faces. What a crap! I bought this Iphone 11 becaUse my old Iphone X no longer took Face ID (after only 1 year use and wasted 3 hours in Apple genius bar but couldn't repair it).

I’ve never experienced such stupid ppl in my life. I updated all of my card information so there shouldn’t be any issues. I just had a 45min phone call with them and I just kept getting forwarded to different ppl. The last lady kept asking question about what’s important to me in a phone and talked about her personal life which is something i don’t care about. I told her that I just want to know the issue with this purchase and nothing else.

0 Stars, Apple replaced a phone thru Apple care and required a credit card hold for the amount of a new phone before they would ship. Apple sent me a “refurbished” non working phone. Apple refuses to send another phone unless I authorize another hold on my credit card for the full amount. You are only allowed two replacements per year, this would use up my last replacement.

Honestly Apple and the Apple Cash “bank” they have are a giant joke. They treat their customers like s***. If any part of your account/wallet/phone is compromised they’ll just right it off as an authorized transaction just so they don’t have to have any liability for their lack of a more secured system. The phones always break and after a few downloads of “important Apple updates” your stuck having to pay extra for any additional storage(even for apps or data that has nothing to do with actual phone security and more for them to watch what you say/do) honestly anyone who has an android or any company besides Apple is better off Biggest pieces of s*** out there All the company cares about is how to further rip you off on their next “great iPhone” and what random service fees or bull loopholes they place in their contracts

To whom it may concern,    Apple Case# 101070318544  I recently had a business Iphone X get returned to me from a employee. Well they had their icloud account locked. I called Apple Support and was shocked. I have done everything possible to prove ownership of this device. Verizon sent me the form to send to them showing I have ownership of the phone. They responded in (2) days that it wasn't sufficient enough. I am currently on the phone with Verizon about this issue. I paid good money for this phone and now its a paper weight. As a small business owner this is disturbing. One thing is for sure! if this doesn't get resolved soon I will be getting rid of all of my company owned Iphones and never doing business with them again.

Our iPhone 6 Plus was having battery issues so my husband called Apple and was instructed by them to take the phone to Best Buy’s for an authentic apple Battery replacement.  We dropped the phone off and paid.  Soon after we get a phone call to my cell notifying us that the battery could not be changed because there was a problem with the mother board not accepting the new battery.  The Geek guy insisted it was a manufacture defect. When we picked up the phone we noticed 2 cracks on the left side of the iPhone screen.  I right away called them from the car and spoke to the manager. After about 75 phone calls  they said  they will take care of it, but here is the BIG problem my husband is a salesman and needs his phone.  So we told them we needed to find a replacement in order to give them the phone to replace the screen.  Well, it wasn’t until months later that my daughter got a new iPhone and lend us her old one.  I called and called and called and no reply, so I personally went in and saw Sergio, he didn’t remember the occurrence and said time had expired and they where no longer repairing the screen on their account.  We tried to reach the CEO of Apple in Cupertino and a nice gentlemen reached out to me and promised he would try and requested a weeks time.  Well, it took him like 4 months and still till today nothing was done and Apple won’t take care of the problem from there Authorized Dealer.  Apple wants us to pay for the screen and battery.  It’s been a battle back and fourth this entire process has been a nightmare.  Apple doesn’t stand behind nothing.  Mr. Banister is just doing his job which only proves Apple is a cheap, heartless, careless company!  They only care about money no customer service at all!  Until today I am still with back and forth communication with Mr Banister with no success and mind you, we sent the original paperwork from The Geek Squad where it says the phone was physically in excellent conditions.   Apple is a Bad Company no backup on their mistakes. In this case they should repair the phone since they recommended and hired Best Buy’s as an Authorized Dealer and the messed up our phone.  This WAS NOT OUR FAULT, it was APPLES fault to alíviate the Apple Store from the battery chaos they created with the updating glitch.  Apple Stand up to your products and mistakes!

Utterly disgraceful. Ordered a MacBook on Thursday to be delivered on Monday. Monday arrives and it tracking says delivery on Tuesday. Tuesday arrives and it’s still ‘processing’ so I call Apple and they assure me it’ll be done by the end of the day to be delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday rolls round and it’s STILL processing so I call again and they say delivery by Thursday. At this rate who knows when I’m going to get my order? It’s already being dispatched six days later than promised! So I’m losing money because I need a new machine for work and Apple won’t even extend to me a ‘good will gesture’.  Oh yeah, and screen time has also become locked out on my phone. I wrote down the password, so I know exactly what it is, but my phone is telling me I have the password wrong. Apparently you can’t remove this without completely resetting your phone and setting up a new Apple ID.   Sick of Apple by this point. Beginning to think I should just buy a pc.

They said needed to check issue with engineers and get back to me. They scheduled a call, and never called back? When I then called, they said, I cant see here your problem. You would expect that for one of the richest companies in the world, with the deepest pockets, they would spend a little more and have a good and premium service to match their pricetag

Even in this PANDEMIC situation, these APPLE company people are behaving so mean. My 5 year old one,while using i-pad ,purchased 2 apple apps unknowingly when popped up.Within 15 min window we immediately called back to the customer care.They said to wait for 48 hours and sent a message that it will not be refunded. Satya Swaroop Pasala of order MV65M0M57Z of $87.99 Satya Swaroop Pasala of order MV 65MOM47K of  10.99$  Two transactions happened at the same time.   We IMMEDIATELY DEACTIVATED THE PURCHASE AND CALLED THE CUSTOMER CARE.WE DID NOT USE A SINGLE HOUR. STILL I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT ELSE THESE PEOPLE NEED.  We did not give authorization  to deduct the amount from our  card.I dont understand how they can do the transaction.Its not less amount to ignore.

Great hardware and love the privacy aspect of IOS  compared to android.   Hope apple will find its way back to creating innovative tech, keeping hold of my old iphone 6s at the moment.  However, apple's subscription cancellation policy is pure bovine waste. Until they change that, I will not use it anymore. There are enough alternatives on the market with better policies.

Run far far away!  I purchased an app for $24.99 and it did not work the way it was intended.  The  app misrepresented and falsely advertised. When I requested a refund, I was told I wouldn’t know for 48 hours.  When I checked back to check status, it was denied.  I called support and they would not tell me why it was denied.  A SUPERVISOR hung up on me.  Wow!  Just wow.  I tried to chat with someone in customer support and they “hung up”. on me.  The rep thought it was perfectly ok that the refund was denied and I was out the $$$.   Such deplorable non existent customer service.  Filing a complaint with the BBB.

I want to make it known that it’s absolutely criminal for Apple to purposefully slow older product models so that customers are forced to upgrade. I have had my iPhone 8+ for only 2 years. I purchased and financed the phone in March 2018. How convenient for Apple that the month my phone is finally paid off that it starts to have problems nudging me to upgrade. Well I won’t. I had to upgrade to this phone to begin with because they did this with the iPhone 6. My 6 was in fine condition, no older than 2 years old as well but I was forced to upgrade working in a daycare at the time where I couldn’t afford to have my phone dying in ten minutes not even being used. This is CRIMINAL. It should be ILLEGAL. I complied with an upgrade in 2018. Not this time. Apple can take their criminal garbage and stick it where the sun doesn’t shine. Going to be sure to file a lawsuit for this because if I’m going to be forced to upgrade, it surely won’t be coming out of my pocket. Shame on you, Apple. Shame on you for being a billion dollar company who breaks their loyal customer’s arms with stunts like this. I know many others have experienced this kind of frustration but I am over it. I’m not paying to upgrade my phone for no reason except that Apple abuses their upper hand.

13 inch MacBook Pro’s screen started flickering a month out of the box. Spent hours and hours over months trouble shooting the issue with Apple Care and the Apple store. Logic board and display were replaced under warranty. The flickering issue continued (out of warranty) after these replacements and I continued to try to trouble shoot the issue with Apple. When no resolution occurred I asked for the computer to be replaced. Apple refused. Communicated with executive offices about the issue. Spent more hours trouble shooting the issue with them. In the end the conclusion they came to was that I helped them identify a software bug causing the problem and that they may fix at some point in the future. However they cannot provide any time line or follow to let me know when the issue has been fixed. I should just trust that they will make the fix and wait it out with a computer with a screen that continues flicker. The whole process described took almost two years and I still have a $2500 dollar computer with a display issue that started within a month of unboxing. No resolution. Throughout the process customer service was abysmal: I’ve been blamed, talked down to, sent on a variety of time consuming paths that all led no where (do this test, that test, oh why did that person tell you to do that test? That won’t help, talk to this person, that person, we can’t find any record of your conversation with that person, etc). There’s been no accountability or follow up. Hours of wasted time.

I want to make it known that it’s absolutely criminal for Apple to purposefully slow older product models so that customers are forced to upgrade. I have had my iPhone 8+ for only 2 years. I purchased and financed the phone in March 2018. How convenient for Apple that the month my phone is finally paid off that it starts to have problems nudging me to upgrade. Well I won’t. I had to upgrade to this phone to begin with because they did this with the iPhone 6. My 6 was in fine condition, no older than 2 years old as well but I was forced to upgrade working in a daycare at the time where I couldn’t afford to have my phone dying in ten minutes not even being used. This is CRIMINAL. It should be ILLEGAL. I complied with an upgrade in 2018. Not this time. Apple can take their criminal garbage and stick it where the sun doesn’t shine. Going to be sure to file a lawsuit for this because if I’m going to be forced to upgrade, it surely won’t be coming out of my pocket. Shame on you, Apple. Shame on you for being a billion dollar company who breaks their loyal customer’s arms with stunts like this. I know many others have experienced this kind of frustration but I am over it. I’m not paying to upgrade my phone for no reason except that Apple abuses their upper hand.

I am an educator that is in desperate need of technology to teach my students from home. I have a school computer but it lacks the capacity to remote teach in an efficient way. I called Apple hoping they could help me through this time but they said they do not do that.  I was willing to purchase a new computer but was hoping they could discount the cost. For such a big company it is disappointing they could not see their way to helping out educators during this crisis. I want the very best for my students and connecting with them has been a struggle. Apple, please think about giving back during this time :((

Just purchased iPhone 11 Pro less than 3 month and suddenly screen started to glitch, called Apple because of Apple care and was on the phone for over 5 hours trying to get them to send me a new phone since all stores are closed.. spoke with 4 different agents including a manager and they asked me to pay 1100 on hold so they can send me the new phone and once I return it back they will release the money. They are not humans all companies are working with everyone due to covid-19 but APPLE they don’t care... one of the worst companies to do business with...never again

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. ABSOLUTELY THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND UNINFORMED, POORLY TRAINED, AND PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you need anything right now from apple, DON'T EXPECT FOR IT TO ARRIVE UNTIL NEARLY A MONTH AFTER (still waiting actually) and don't expect any of the employees to be ""Geniuses""cause they have no idea what they are talking about. I have spoken to them countless times about this issue, and as a student and healthcare worker, I am incredibly upset by not just the complaints of slow shipping, but the glitching and sudden failure of apple products DURING A PANDEMIC. They are absolutely awful and honestly have been for a while. Would highly recommend a PC next time.

My remote does not work. Remote never really worked since I received the remote. Now I can't watch it. I called spectrum and was advised to contact Apple. I spoke with the rude person- Posing a a supervisor. Advising me that my remote is still under warranty, BUT I have to PAY $60.00 for them to send out, and once I send the old remote back I can get me money back. Well, unfortunately I paid bills, and do not have $60 available, and given my funds are different right now. Due to corona. Unable to work overtime, not all my hours. He couldn't even waive it.

It was my only phone and it costed another 300 to 400 dollars to fix my touch screen. it is to expensive and it breaks easily not to mention it is a total rip-off when it comes to repair the damn phone that easily breaks.

The lid on my AirPods became loose. I contacted Apple customer service hi advised the only option was to either send the case back to Apple for repair under warranty or visit a Apple Service Centre. I explained that I was in isolation due to Covid-19 and I did not want to leave my home thus putting me and my family at risk for none essential travel. I kindly asked whether Apple could extend my warranty until after the lockdown was lifted then I would visit a service centre. Apple refused the extension of the warrant on the AirPod case.

13 inch MacBook Pro’s screen started flickering a month out of the box. Spent hours and hours over months trouble shooting the issue with Apple Care and the Apple store. Logic board and display were replaced under warranty. The flickering issue continued (out of warranty) after these replacements and I continued to try to trouble shoot the issue with Apple. When no resolution occurred I asked for the computer to be replaced. Apple refused. Communicated with executive offices about the issue. Spent more hours trouble shooting the issue with them. In the end the conclusion they came to was that I helped them identify a software bug causing the problem and that they may fix at some point in the future. However they cannot provide any time line or follow to let me know when the issue has been fixed. I should just trust that they will make the fix and wait it out with a computer with a screen that continues flicker. The whole process described took almost two years and I still have a $2500 dollar computer with a display issue that started within a month of unboxing. No resolution. Throughout the process customer service was abysmal: I’ve been blamed, talked down to, sent on a variety of time consuming paths that all led no where (do this test, that test, oh why did that person tell you to do that test? That won’t help, talk to this person, that person, we can’t find any record of your conversation with that person, etc). There’s been no accountability or follow up. Hours of wasted time. Horrible company. Horrible customer service experience. At the end of the day my computer (that did not work from day one) still does not work properly and in addition now has keyboard issues. My only consolation is that reading the reviews here, I realize that many others have had similar experiences with Apple products and service. I was a long time Apple fan who will not be purchasing Apple products in the future. I have learned my lesson.

Update2: Guess what I had at my door step today. A package from Apple, that was promised not be delivered to me by several customer representatives. On top of that, I couldn't just give it back to UPS, because return shipping was with Fedex!!! Absolutely unacceptable. Horrible experience with apple. That a package couldn't have been taken back 45 min after I placed my order is beyond my comprehension. That service representatives just hang op on me, leave chats, etc. even though I'm simply asking them to call UPS to intercept my package.  I was offered no compensation for the mess whatsoever. Since it's Thursday my package won't be returned until next week and then I'll have to wait 5 days for my refund. Absolutely horrible company. Makes billions but can't help out a teleworking customer who needs a better machine for work at home. I should have gotten my gift card payments back. Instead, I had to increase my exposure risk to the virus. Thanks Apple  Update: They shipped it this morning at 6 AM. I can't believe this. The representative on the phone assured me it wouldn't be shipped. Now I have to go to the UPS store to return it, all while we're under ""stayathome"" order. The person I chatted with just left the chat, after I asked them to contact UPS to intercept the package. I am absolutely furious about this. Apple used to have good customer service. It's gotten absolutely unacceptable. Will not buy from apple again after I used my apple store card.  This is a review for an issue with their customer service and their ordering options I just experienced. I ordered an iMac, but changed my mind about it and wanted to get a different one just 30 min later. So I tried to login online to cancel my order. An error occurred, so I started chatting with one of their representatives. First I asked if I can switch my order. She asked me so many questions and would not understand what I wanted to do. 20 min later when I finally got her to understand that I wanted to cancel my order, she writes ""Oooh..., it's too late now, because they already shipped it"". What the heck. In theory fast shipping sounds great. But man Apple, give your customer an hour of a grace period so we can change our order within an hour, if we need to! It was literally marked in process for shipping within 45 min. I paid with an apple store gift card, so now I can't just order a new one. No, I have to wait for my order to get here, then send it back to Apple, then wait for my refund, then place a new order. If the representative would have just cancelled my order within the first 5 min, this wouldn't have happened. I'm so upset at the inefficiency of this... I'm teleworking because of COVID-19 right now and need a better computer for data processing, since I can't work in my office. Now I have to wait probably more than a week. Yes I changed my mind about an order, but common that happens. The representative should have been way more on top of things. I called and they are processing a return and the representative on the phone literally interrupted me to just try to issue a return as quickly as possible, because she understood how frustrating that was. I think Apple should refund me immediately, instead of me having to wait for the return, because this was the fault of their customer service being so slow!  Just if anyone is interested. I wanted to change my order because I realized that you cannot change the RAM in the 21.5"" iMac models yourself, but you can in the 27"". This is ridiculous by the way. Money over costumer satisfaction for this company seems to be the motto.

Please don’t use Apple wallet!! My account was hacked and started sending out money without my facial recognition, pin, or anything that would state I agree with the transaction! Apple refuses to take accountability or to check if they do have a hack problem. They will not help you if this ever happens. Money started flowing out of my accounts, to accounts of people who weren’t even receiving the money! This is real and serious.

Despite being the manufacturer and supplier of the product I ordered, Apple has somehow managed to delay the order I placed for three to four weeks when every other supplier was able to ship them out the next day (and this was for a product that was in stock on the day I ordered it).

Had an old 2011 macbook, HD died and it was impossible to get internet recovery to work it just to get the image just to pay big dollars for them to fix it.  ipads get obsolete so fast and now with them settling for how they treated the iphone users restricting its performance to save battery.

Lousy - did the upgrade on my laptop only to find neither mouse nor external keyboard worked after doing upgrade - 4 hours with apple on phone only to be told it was the connector (given computer doesn't come with USB ports was repeatedly asked to plug USB mouse into the laptop!!!) - ordered new connectors - was promised link to senior staff in Apple so they would call me back - link did not work and neither did new connectors - after 2 days and 3 connectors finally all three connectors miraculously work yet there is no reason - funny how it all stopped following an upgrade. No reason for it to stop working (coincidence according to Apple that it stopped at the exact point of time of the upgrade) and no reason it started working again - Apple won't admit the upgrade caused a problem but I'm now extremely worried about any future upgrades to the system. That is nearly 2 days of me calling Apple, £50 worse off buying connectors I never actually needed and a failure for links within the email for them to call me back to actually work!! NOT HAPPY  and to cap it all to sort the problem going forward and not need to have a usb connection to the laptop I bought a wireless keyboard - in order to pair with the laptop it appears you need to connect it via USB to the laptop after which you can disconnect - erm that would be the USB connection they don't have on the laptop then - that would mean you need a connector to pair the two devices - that would be the connector they said not to use and which wasn't working for 2 days after their update then - erm bit of a design flaw then isn't there!

For this reason, I purchased several  Apple Devices.  The past month, I have been trying to get in contact with the Apple Support team, to try to reset my password for my Apple ID, it has been 15 days since I've been waiting to receive a recovery email or someone that will contact me from Apple.

She made the situation  worse. So now, I'm stuck with two devices that I've paid a lot of money and unable to get access to. I had tried all the required  processes to  recover my  password. I have spoken to many Apple Support and receive no conclusion to my problem.  I have tried everything that they ask me to do.  Be patent Go to forget my password.  Reset the devices Create a new Apple ID  Use another Device   No Apple Supporter or Apple Supervisor  knows  the step to recovering a password.  According to the floor supervisor,she is the highest person to speak to, and she does not know anything about the steps to follow.   Apple pride themselves  on how great their devices are, how about providing training to the Apple Support Team so they will  know detail by detail how to handle customer concern with care.

I have an issue with an iphone that I bought from the Arden Fair Apple Store in July of 2019. Between trouble shooting with Verizon and Apple customer service, we've identified that it is likely a known Apple issue that is covered by the company, once confirmed. With all of the local apple stores shutdown for COVID-19, I have to mail it in without a loaner phone which was quoted to take 10 days to 4 weeks. Waiting 4 weeks for a phone that I use for multi-factor authentication to be able to work from home is unacceptable. I recognize that they have a number of challenges in this unprecedented time but their consumers do as well. I have to be able to work from home. I came up will a few creative solutions such as having them pay the trade in credit as if the phone was fully functional and I'd buy the newest model. If the diagnostics came back as another issue that wasn't covered by apple, they can charge my card back for the credit. Another option would be to allow me to purchase a phone and return it, if they are able to fix it under their warranty. Both options, were rejected. The only solutions involve me purchasing another phone at full price without a credit for what's likely a defect in a phone I bought from their store in July or waiting 10 days - 4 weeks for them to resolve the issue (that's after I wait two days for them to send me a box to ship it to them). This isn't an acceptable option when I need it to work from home. We own three iphones in our house (XR and two 7s that we were planning to upgrade), a Macbook Pro, and 2 pairs of airpods. For a situation where Apple could have worked with us and given me the $120 trade-in credit on a $1000 phone and even charged me back if it wasn't a warranty covered issue, they lost Apple customers for life.  The new plan is to go to Costco and buy the latest Samsung Galaxy today while they repair the other phone for me to resell online. I'm sure between the time they spent talking to me on the phone, shipping my phone back and forth, paying for an appointment at a local authorized non-apple phone repair store, running diagnostics and fixing the issue.

I bought the IPhone 11 Jan 30th 2020 after my IPhone 6 was failing . I was told by the apple store It would take awhile to get use to it . The phone was a mess from day one , the touch screen was not sensitive, face recognition didn’t work , my calls would drop ( every single call ) , all my apps on my phone wouldn’t work ( Facebook, YouTube etc ) it didn’t matter which one . So after about 7-10 days I thought this is not something I am doing it has to be the phone annnnd then the real hell began !  I made my first call to customer service and I’ll just try to keep it short , after about 20 calls to customer service including talking with several senior advisors, taking my phone in to Best Buy , factory resetting my phone , blaming my carrier I’ve had for 12 years I was told there is nothing wrong with my phone .  Now through this process I admit I lost it and cried - I told the senior advisors I’m crying over a damn phone , I give up ! I have owned IPhones from the beginning ( after we all had the flip ) I AM team IPhone . Why would anyone spend this much of their time and energy dealing with tech support if nothing was wrong ?  I didn’t ask for a refund but I asked for a exchange on the phone ( Best Buy had checked mine ) mine was / is in mint condition and was told “ If you bought a new car and a sensor light was bad would you want a new car ?”  My reply was “ If I bought a new car and the engine blew within two weeks I would want a new car .”   So I still have a IPhone 11 that is a bad apple and instead of this company making it right which would be easy for them ( it was 2 weeks old ) here I am today 😞 .  Honestly I don’t even want to talk to another person at Apple after crying over frustration/ phone I’ve had enough .  **** I’m not tech savvy and I just found this site so anyone can take this review how they want , it was my experience!

It was out of warranty by this stage but still not a reliable or economical product for the price  - I had to replace my computer as I’ve been forced to work from home due to the COVI19 I bought a brand new MacBook Pro last week - on the first day it started to malfunction and the helpline told me the computer appeared to be faulty after they walked me through the steps to reset my new MacBook, it never turned back on - I spoke to the help line and they told me to bring it into the Genius Bar, when I got there it was closed due to the lockdown for 2 weeks. The store is not near my house so it would have been helpful to let me know this information on the phone - I went through 5 representatives before I could speak to a manager she informed me that the store was opened just for one day for existing clients who need support and told me she updated my case notes and they would be expecting me at the store if I rushed.  - I only was told this an hour before the official shutdown. Left work early, jumped in an Uber which cost me $35 to get to the Apple store on time - when I arrived they said there was no notes on my file and denied me from entering the store.  I cried and told the man at the door what had happened and he told me I was endangering everyone’s health and was extremely cold, letting other customers through for repairs.  - I called the hotline again who tried to get through to the store but was unsuccessful, they apologised for everything that had happened and promised they would do everything to help me and would call me back - when a representative called me back he said all the could do was send it in for a repairs ( in a new computer I haven’t even used yet) but I would have to take it more then 2 hours each way on public transport to have a technician look at it or wait until they reopen, which appears to be indefinite  - I told him this wasn’t an option. I spent all my saving $2000 on a new computer so I could work from home and keep my job during a scary period, if they couldn’t return the item for me even through their online store I just want to sent the faulty computer back and I obtain a refund so I can buy a computer from Microsoft - I don’t have any more saving and I was relying on that computer to keep my job. Now I have no work and Apple have taken my $2000 and left me with a faulty MacBook I can not even turn on I am just so sad that you could treat a human being like this - I explained this to the representative and when I started to cry he said I’m going to hang up now, that was the end of the call. - I have emailed the manager who promised me they would handle the case due to their poor management last week, yet I have emailed twice since then and no reply. - we are about to go into lock down, I have four more days to resolve this issue otherwise I won’t have a job next week, I have no more income coming in and now I am down $2000  Please Apple, I can’t believe this is your customer service, you have stolen my money in a time of extreme need

I have been with IPhones for 8 years  . I have always had some problems with the battery , but  it was something I could live with by charging it more often and carrying the pocket juice battery around. This time I have upgraded to IPhone 8 and only owned it for 6 months. My battery would drop  from  being fully charged to 100 % to 10% within seconds of use and would start restarting, but never able to use it again unless plugged right into the charger. I went to apple store in Calgary and was told the battery has a corrosion from moisture??? This is IPhone 8 and it is water resistant according to the description of the characteristics. Never mind it has never even been dropped into water/snow/etc. I was told that the warranty doesn’t cover same and there’s nothing they could do for me. They offered me to buy a new phone!!!  I also contacted  Apple customer service on the phone and spoke to the senior advisor and he also said they had to go with the store notes and could not help me in this case. I have been a loyal customer of the Apple products for the last 8 years. It leaves me in a great dissatisfaction with the service and the attitude of the company.

It is very difficult to contact the support since I bought my MacBook Pro 2017 in September (the 1st week crashed three times!!!). It’s very difficult to tell them what are the problems to try to fix it (get stuck many times in mail, preview, and sometimes it’s like working with windows vista even browsing their website) and the performance is getting worse and worse. So not happy with the product as I was before, and very disappointed with the customer care support. If I could, I would have bought a chrome book. I hate also the fact that I cannot their apps on the App Store...

Had a 7 day trial for an app, the reminder in my phone somehow didn’t work so i got charged almost £30 for an app for the YEAR, called up the day it renewed so hadn’t used the app and spoke to two advisors, both refused my request for a refund so now I’m out of pocket for an app I don’t even use or want. Fair enough if i left it days or weeks but the day after? Also even tried to come to a compromise and asked if I could just pay for a month but no nothing was done so won’t be bothering with even trying any apps now. Any other companies like Microsoft always help out in situations like this so apple should do the same.

I sent it away for repair, comes back only to have the same problem happen.  I go to the NOT SO GENIUS BAR where they recommended they evaluate overnight.  I did this THREE times.  Was working for 2 weeks and died again.  I call to insist I receive a new computer because after all it was purchased not even a year ago AND I bought 3 year Apple plan.  They refuse to give me a new computer!!! I now have to go to Apple for the 5th time!! Most disappointing of all... they won’t even give you a loaner computer!!!

Screens don't last and you end up paying £160 just to fix the screen. Mine broke 4 months after being repaired in the Apple shop in Bristol with a screen protector on. I honestly think they do cheap ones on purpose to get your money as there's not even a warranty that covers it. I'm sure Apple know they will break shortly...so they make lots of Money from it.  Don't buy an apple phone. Will rip you off.

So I purchased ~15 Macbook Pro i9 (top model) in summer 2018. In 9 months it died due to swollen battery. It was fixed under warranty (logic board, CPU, memory, SSD, keyboard, trackpad, part of case were replaced). In about 3 months after that screen was replaced because of dust inside (12-15 pixels in size). Now, after 1.5 years since purchase battery is swollen again (confirmed in service, need to make backup and send on another 2 weeks repair). Honestly, not something I expect from purchase of top model of macbook pro.

It is horrible, I have no words to explain how did I feel as loyal customer for 10 years . This is what big corporations do.

Had Macbook Pro early 2015 model purchased February 22, 2016. Noticed screen delaminating so called AppleCare. Was told it may be covered under the extended warranty but they will have to have a person look at it so they booked me an appointment at the store. Checked in and rep said that it was no longer covered under 4 year extended screen warranty as I was 10 days past. He showed me the details that were typed in by AppleCare during our phone call. This showed I supposedly talked to a rep and then a supervisor and was told the screen repair would not be covered under warranty, and if I wanted it fixed outside warranty I would have to go to a Mac store. I told the rep that is not what I was told and I only spoke to one person. I requested they pull up the phone recording to confirm (no go ... those are only to support the company not the customer). The store rep said he can do nothing but I can call Apple Care again. I did this from the noisy store (loud music + some presentation going on at same time) and was put forward to upper support. Over the next 40 minutes I was asked questions and then told they cannot do anything as I am 10 days over. Apparently the warranty starts when you purchase the system. Too bad to me I ordered via our university portal and it shipped from China ... so I never even received the system until March. And my system showed initial file creations were March 28.  Main point is if they would have told me my screen would not be covered, as they stated they did, on the phone I would not have driven 1 hour to the Store and spent 2 hours at the Store.   I switched to Mac 4 years ago with MacPro server system at work, Macbook Pro, ipad, iphone ... all under AppleCare and never a single claim. After this I am divesting in all my Apple products. I was going to wait for a new 13"" Macbook Pro to come out with the better keyboard but now have ordered a HP Elitebook. Looking for replacements for my other Apple devices. Being treated the way I was is an insult. Having Apple write outright lies on their phone system report is worse.

I got locked into the Apple eco-system because my work gave me an iPhone for work - everything is proprietary connection, apps, accessories.   When I left the company and had to hand the phone back, I decided to try an Android phone (Samsung S series).

Apple has a rotten core and you only discover it if you dare to trouble them with a concern or issue with your device. A new iMac purchased in 2016 presented problems within a few weeks of taking ownership - I flagged this to Apple who offered a remote support ""guru"" who took me through first level diagnostics, offered to help if problems persisted and then went MIA. I have a record of dozens of messages in the four years I've had this computer and its just steadily gotten worse and worse. Finally after a rather aggressive attempt to get their attention and demanding my money back they offer to get the iMac checked out so the problem can be identified and a suitable resolution found. The iMac was proven to have both faulty hardware and software - so the evidence of four years of pain is clear.  Instead of compensating, replacing the faulty iMac the machine was partially repaired with a new logic board but the software issue remained.  Apple suggested that was all they were prepared to do.   I can say with certainty that whilst Apple presents as a cool and attractive brand it simply does not bear close inspection.  This is a rotten to the core outfit with draconian policies.  A once loyal customer lost. Legal action now commencing.  As an aside I was blown away with this Trustpilot score....how poor is this business?

I have a terrible story to share. My uncle is an 80 decorated vietnam veteran who served our country for 30 years. Steve suffers from PTSD. My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Holly’s password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Holly’s phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Holly’s phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Holly’s phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steve’s phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone. For the Apple employees involved in this case, I hope your loved one never has to experience this!

I go on vacation with a new Mac Pro a new iPhone ten new iPods an iwatch and all the attachments you have made me purchase. I sit next to everyone on the last three flights, brought all my apple products to keep me occupied and here i sit... watching everyone around me with non apple products connecting to wifi watching movies, tv shows, you tube.. all are connect to their head set that is not an iPods set.... and here I sit with no  access.. I can't even connect my iPod to my Mac Pro, I can't watch youtube or Netflix or even get on the southwest server. I have been traveling in total car ride, plane, layovers for 7 hours and I have not been able to access a thing. it is not my service it is not the connection it is simply your product that has gone down the hole. It has glitches and complications that no one else seems to experience. I am everything apple and I am sitting here writing an email out of pure frustration verse watching a movie like everyone else around me. what is gong on with this company. my iPhone ten is by far the worst phone I have ever had from you guys and I owned an iPhone 4. I really hope I didn't waste my money. I own everything from an iwatch to an iPhone, to a Mac Pro, iPad, to a Ipods. and this is what I have to deal with. I am a walking apple commercial who can't access full wifi ever. I might have to move on and accept that you guys are going in the wrong direction which is super disappointing.

I drove in rush hour to the Galleria Mall to get to the store in time only for them to tell me they have to ship my Macbook somewhere and that it will cost me approx. $475 and if there is a difference in the amount needed I would be refunded which I know is not the case.  Now, you dismiss my issue and say I can cancel the mail-in. Is this how a loyal customer is treated? I am appalled and want someone above you to explain why I was told none of this when I originally called and spoke to someone named Branden who assured me my box was being sent to me and I will receive information on the cost of the repair.

Had Macbook Pro early 2015 model purchased February 22, 2016. Noticed screen delaminating so called AppleCare. Was told it may be covered under the extended warranty but they will have to have a person look at it so they booked me an appointment at the store. Checked in and rep said that it was no longer covered under 4 year extended screen warranty as I was 10 days past. He showed me the details that were typed in by AppleCare during our phone call. This showed I supposedly talked to a rep and then a supervisor and was told the screen repair would not be covered under warranty, and if I wanted it fixed outside warranty I would have to go to a Mac store. I told the rep that is not what I was told and I only spoke to one person. I requested they pull up the phone recording to confirm (no go ... those are only to support the company not the customer). The store rep said he can do nothing but I can call Apple Care again. I did this from the noisy store (loud music + some presentation going on at same time) and was put forward to upper support. Over the next 40 minutes I was asked questions and then told they cannot do anything as I am 10 days over. Apparently the warranty starts when you purchase the system. Too bad to me I ordered via our university portal and it shipped from China ... so I never even received the system until March. And my system showed initial file creations were March 28.  Main point is if they would have told me my screen would not be covered, as they stated they did, on the phone I would not have driven 1 hour to the Store and spent 2 hours at the Store.   I switched to Mac 4 years ago with MacPro server system at work, Macbook Pro, ipad, iphone ... all under AppleCare and never a single claim. After this I am divesting in all my Apple products. I was going to wait for a new 13"" Macbook Pro to come out with the better keyboard but now have ordered a HP Elitebook. Looking for replacements for my other Apple devices. Being treated the way I was is an insult. Having Apple write outright lies on their phone system report is worse.

seriously .. how does this company even survive. I guess there are a lot of sheep in this world that are happy to pay a high price for sub-par products.  There phones are horrible and restricted. I got locked into the Apple eco-system because my work gave me an iPhone for work - everything is proprietary connection, apps, accessories.   When I left the company and had to hand the phone back, I decided to try an Android phone (Samsung S series). Oh my word - such freedom - so many add-ons, apps, accessories that all use open standards. Following that my family also started to move out of the Apple eco-system and we are all happy with having Android as our  mobile phone platform and Windows 10 as our laptop/desktop platform.

Settings changed after an update without asking me and I’ve now lost all my precious messages from people important to me. I can’t now get them back, been on chat with them for 1 and a half hours this evening and been told they are unrecoverable. They offered to phone me but the person I was chatting with said they can’t be recovered but could try phoning anyway.

Apple has a rotten core and you only discover it if you dare to trouble them with a concern or issue with your device. A new iMac purchased in 2016 presented problems within a few weeks of taking ownership - I flagged this to Apple who offered a remote support ""guru"" who took me through first level diagnostics, offered to help if problems persisted and then went MIA. I have a record of dozens of messages in the four years I've had this computer and its just steadily gotten worse and worse. Finally after a rather aggressive attempt to get their attention and demanding my money back they offer to get the iMac checked out so the problem can be identified and a suitable resolution found. The iMac was proven to have both faulty hardware and software - so the evidence of four years of pain is clear.  Instead of compensating, replacing the faulty iMac the machine was partially repaired with a new logic board but the software issue remained.  Apple suggested that was all they were prepared to do.   I can say with certainty that whilst Apple presents as a cool and attractive brand it simply does not bear close inspection.  This is a rotten to the core outfit with draconian policies.  A once loyal customer lost. Legal action now commencing.  As an aside I was blown away with this Trustpilot score....how poor is this business?

I have a terrible story to share. My uncle is an 80 decorated vietnam veteran who served our country for 30 years. Steve suffers from PTSD. My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Holly’s password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Holly’s phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Holly’s phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Holly’s phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steve’s phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone. For the Apple employees involved in this case, I hope your loved one never has to experience this!

Where do I begin.,..... I have had apple products as long as I can remember. I have faithfully bought literally every new update on the iphone and all accessories you have to offer. I go on vacation with a new Mac Pro a new iPhone ten new iPods an iwatch and all the attachments you have made me purchase. I sit next to everyone on the last three flights, brought all my apple products to keep me occupied and here i sit... watching everyone around me with non apple products connecting to wifi watching movies, tv shows, you tube.. all are connect to their head set that is not an iPods set.... and here I sit with no  access.. I can't even connect my iPod to my Mac Pro, I can't watch youtube or Netflix or even get on the southwest server. I have been traveling in total car ride, plane, layovers for 7 hours and I have not been able to access a thing. it is not my service it is not the connection it is simply your product that has gone down the hole. It has glitches and complications that no one else seems to experience. I am everything apple and I am sitting here writing an email out of pure frustration verse watching a movie like everyone else around me. what is gong on with this company. my iPhone ten is by far the worst phone I have ever had from you guys and I owned an iPhone 4. I really hope I didn't waste my money. I own everything from an iwatch to an iPhone, to a Mac Pro, iPad, to a Ipods. and this is what I have to deal with. I am a walking apple commercial who can't access full wifi ever. I might have to move on and accept that you guys are going in the wrong direction which is super disappointing. I want to point out that all I can access is email. why? why can I not access anything else?

I'm so confused as to what to do. I drove in rush hour to the Galleria Mall to get to the store in time only for them to tell me they have to ship my Macbook somewhere and that it will cost me approx. $475 and if there is a difference in the amount needed I would be refunded which I know is not the case.  Now, you dismiss my issue and say I can cancel the mail-in. Is this how a loyal customer is treated? I am appalled and want someone above you to explain why I was told none of this when I originally called and spoke to someone named Branden who assured me my box was being sent to me and I will receive information on the cost of the repair.  Who is to say that once I mail MY computer to your terrible company that I will not be charged more or change the story and you have my laptop that costs over $2,000. You can't be serious!!!

I’m just wondering if you are in our shoes do you think you will trust the watch who had issue twice saying we put faith on our technician.. my question is this what happen if in further future that happens again and it is not under anymore of warranty how can you help us.. how can we put faith on the that product.. common don’t be ridiculous that you will not ask for a replacement if you are in our situation., just because it’s not your you don’t care..

I’ve been a loyal Apple consumer for 15 years. The products are sexy, shiny, and ( used to be) in the forefront of technology. I have a MacBook Pro 3 years old. It has been non working since January 10, 2020. And in Apples care since January 26, 2020. It is February 16,2020 and I still don’t have a laptop. This might be acceptable if it were being fixed however, I was told by a senior on January 10 that there have been too serviced on the laptop for the same problem and that I’m a candidate for a replacement laptop.

She couldn’t answer that and said she needs time to reach out to her team to find out ship schedule of the new computer. So, I’ve been waiting 5 days for my follow up call to tell me noting. This is absolutely ludicrous. Other details that have happened are: being told by support to take laptop into a store and have them ship it to Apple since no one knew why Fed Ex didn’t pick it up. The store shipped it out and it came back days later repaired not replaced. No one knew why since the paperwork clearly states REPLACEMENT. Apple support could not answer why.  After 5 more days of waiting Apple care informs me to go to the store and pick up my old computer and Fed Ex would pick it up in several days. Why would I waste my time picking up something that was already in the hands of the place to be shipped. Apparently the store that had it refused to ship it back. After many phone calls they decided to ship it. There have been plenty of other unpleasant exchanges. Bottom line APPLE SUPPORT is hardly supportive. Apple -FAIl

I have been a loyal apple customer for years. I own a Macbook Pro, an iMac all one and 5 different iPhones from me down to my 5 children. So 5 days ago my iphone X went out and I could not update it or restore it. I made an appointment with the Apple Store in Northbrook the guy tried to do the same things I did at home and was getting the same error message that I got. I was t then told that the logic board went out and it would cost me $ 549.00 to replace the phone or if I was eligible for an upgrade I could do that.He said my warranty  had expired just 42 days ago. I told the guy I had no plans to upgrade and that he could see my phone was spotless and in excellent condition.  I then called 1-800-MY-APPLE to see if they would replace my phone being that the warranty just expired a little over 30 days ago so you guessed it they refused to replace the phone. Apple is a freaking JOKE and a RIP off. This is their way to force people to upgrade to their new products. Well guess what I refuse to remain loyal to a company that could care less about us.

One day,  Apple just stopped to update the software of my (older type) iphone.   I would accept that, but the  problem is, the  Apps for this Iphone type are now all removed from the APPSTORE.   Given,  they ONLY WAY to install app,  is via the APPSTORE, my  Iphone became virtually useless.  I can understand,  newer Apps may not work on older Iphones, and that is not the issue  here.    But I find it wrong,  the removed all older apps from the appstore.     If the writer of the Apps would remove them,  fair enough.  But it leaves a bad taste if Apple deletes simply all of them, and I have to buy a new IPhone for this reason.  The old one did what I needed.

She did tell me that my warranty had expired but that I could mail it in free of charge they will look at it and figure out what’s wrong with it then they’ll call me to let me know how much it would be then I would pay then they would return my MacBook Air. However we got disconnected at the end when I called back I got a  different person named Samantha Who wanted to help me troubleshoot again I let her know that I needed to just mail in the computer because the troubleshooting didn’t work with the last lady, she said that I might want to try that before I mailed it in because I already have a bill that it was in my emails and if I really wanted to have the box sent to me it was going to cost me almost $500 and then once they figure out what’s wrong with it if it’s more or less then the $500 they will either give you your money remaining back or charge you more before you could get it back! It is absolutely insane that we spent so much on these products, and then there is no support on getting them fixed I’m all about paying if my warranty is expired but $500 just to have it looked at is absolutely ridiculous.

Had been using my Mini I pad for 5yrs with no problems logging in with PIN Number . With my Hotmail Email address. I went to use it the other day and it has an Activation lock on it by Apple . Spent 2 hours on the phone with them and they kept saying You have to log in with your G Mail address and Password. Told them I have NEVER had a G Mail address. Have had the same Hotmail for the past 20yrs which  was on their System . They refuse to unlock my I Pad as it may be stolen ,even though I have the Original Box it came in from Big W. Cant find the receipt .So They have made My I Pad useless.In the Garbage bin . Will NEVER buy another Apple Product. It seems they can Lock your I Pad any time they want, without warning, if it hasnt been used for 3 weeks, they mark it down as possible Missing or stolen ???. Treat everybody as a thief.

The store + phone lines, customer service is atrocious. They blame each other if there's an issue instead of helping you and sorting it out.  No marked point or desk in store where you can get help, unhelpful staff.   I had an appointment at the Aberdeen store in the UK. I arrived in plenty of time. I took both my ipad and phone down to be looked at.  No one was their to help so I sat at the back and waited for a very long time trying to get help.  I began to feel ill due to the heat and the person sitting next to me agreed it was far to warm. He looked ill/tired because of the heat as well and had also been waiting a long time. I asked someone if i could get some cold water as I felt ill. Was told no and directed to Boots which turned out to be much cooler.  I went to buy some water and went outside to cool down as well. It was cool outside.  When i came back there was someone in with a tablet talking to someone. It wasn't  until i spoke to them that i was told you don't sit at the back of the store. I was not advised when i made the appointment, over the phone that they have this idiotic system.  When I was getting up to go outside feeling ill, dizzy, nauseous i knocked my ipad onto the floor , obviously the screen bloody broke.  When i was being helped with my phone i over heard i presume the male boss talking to a female manager talking about why no one had been at the front helping. Turns out someone was off and they where very busy.  I couldn't wait to get out of the store as id been there for about an hour, so  I complained about the long wait, over the phone which made me feel ill and the damage to my ipad but was fobbed off by the store and phone line service.

Went to Apple Westfield Stratford City to replace the left airpod for my Airpods Pro at their Genius Bar. Lady who served me did not seem like she knew what she was doing, didnt even look to see what was the problem and replaced the airpod right away. However, i was told to wait 20 minutes for it to charge and then again 40 minutes for the new left airpod to pair with the right existing airpod. I said Im not going to wait 40 minutes and she just left. No goodbye. I felt this was unprofessional and reported to the manager. He seemed to let on that there is nothing wrong with this behaviour and asked me what I would like him to do about it. Properly train your staff mate, its not my problem but yours for losing customers this way and making a bad rep for the company.

Quite possibly the worst support I have ever received. After receiving several prompts from my iMac I updated the OS to Catalina. After the install none of my Adobe Creative Suite would work so I called Apple support to see if there was a fix. They suggested reverting to an older OS such as mojave and then talked me through the process, which to cut a long story short has resulted in an iMac that now has corrupt firmware that means it cannot find the Macintosh HD drive and the computer no longer works. Apple support have arranged to collect the iMac and repair it but this will take a week and even after explaining that I do stock/share trading and this could cost me a lot of money they offered no alternative and said that as my system is out of warranty they will not accept responsibility. F u apple!   I sold my iPhone, iPad and MacBook last year and switched to Android because I strongly disagree Apples business practices and pricing that they have implemented over the past couple of years. Looks like my iMac will be going next.

Just had a bad experience with Apple customer service, My Charger blew up, went with a pop. Does not work anymore, did the usual checks with apple service live chat and confirmed laptop is all ok, so I asked if I am still under warranty, I had to do all the work to find out even though they had my serial number (can't get into chat without it) he would not help me and asked me to take my laptop to a shop which is miles away, would take me a morning to get there and back, we already confirmed it was the charger that is broken so what is the issue of sending me a replacement? Instead I have to wait for a few days for somebody to have a look at my broken charger, and longer multiple trips no doubt when buying a new charger for an extortionate price will work out cheaper in the end while getting me up and running the same day, it's done on purpose. And there is no customer service whatsoever. if they can't even be bothered to honour their warranty which I should be covered for, I am definitely not going to be buying mac again. For the sake of that charger you can expect to lose out on many thousands of pounds worth of purchases from me.

Service for apple care is absolutely terrible. I had my phone stolen and the only way to submit a claim is to get a verification code that is sent to your phone...which is the thing you're trying to replace. They do literally nothing at all to help you, they told me to wait 7 business days to get a friend’s phone number approved to get a verification code on it just to start the claim process. The employees do nothing to help. In store employees tell you to call apple support, apple support says they can't do anything until you get a code. Totally terrible experience, not designed with the consumer in mind what so ever. Simply made to encourage you to buy an additional apple product. Would not recommend. Apple has lost their way since Cook took over.

Several calls later explaining that phone sent as replacement does not work and where is my replacement? Go ahead and sent new/not working one back, we’ll take care of you. Apparently the gal that I talked to gave me bad information and I have to start a new case because the other one was cancelled, I don’t know how since I never got a working phone! WHAT??

I have literally spent my entire Saturday on the phone with apple.com to get refunded for charges on my credit card that I DID not authorize!!  I authorized a 1 time $.99 transaction and apparently Apple just keeps your credit card on file so the user can continue to buy things when they want. Mind you it's an 11 year olds phone. I was treated good by the rep, but when the supervisor Heather got on the phone she was very rude and condescending I asked to speak with her supervisor and she flat out told me no and proceeded to hang up on me!!  This is why I myself will never own an iphone.  Only reason my kids have them is because someone else purchased them. That big of a company and that's the best you can do?  Unreal!!! I urge anyone that has a child with an iPhone to NEVER buy anything off apple.com. I guess anyway they can make a dollar.

I've been an Apple customer for over 22 years. I own three iPhones and seven Macintosh computers. I used to be a loyal and proud Apple consumer. The beginning of the end for Apple products quality and customer service began when Steve Jobs' illness left him unable to lead his company the way he originally did since Apple’s inception.  Now, Apple's customer service and product quality is as bad as Microsoft. Apple always wanted parity with Microsuck, and now Apple's finally gotten its wish.  In my most recent case, Apple's AirPod product never achieves its advertised talk time. I replaced the first generation AirPods I purchased because they were conking out well before their advertised talk time. After the replacement pair fared no better, I decided to pay the increase in price for the AirPod 2nd generation. Big mistake. The extra money I spent didn't buy me Apple's claimed talk time. I replaced the 2nd generation AirPods three times under warranty. The problem continued. Since I could no longer receive a refund on my original purchase, I requested that Apple permit me to exchange my AirPod 2's for the Airpod Pro. I was more than willing to pay the cost difference. Apple refused. All I could do is keep returning the AirPods until my original warranty expired. Apple sent me a complimentary new pair of 2nd Generation Airpods. I appreciated the gesture but it would have made more dollars and sense if Apple had just permitted me to pay for an upgrade and return the malfunctioning AirPods product. The most current AirPods I have still do not function as advertised.   Thankfully, I have an extended warranty from my credit card company. I am hoping its worth the time and trouble I took to file a claim. I’ve been told by a representative from my credit card company that AirPod claims are quite commonplace. I am not surprised. Advice to others reading this: Never purchase an Apple product unless you use a credit card with an extended warranty program.  When you call Apple Tech Support or Apple Customer Service be prepared to have a significant portion of your precious time wasted. I lost track of how many dozens of hours I have spent with Apple over the last 10 months, attempting to seek a remedy. You are likely to spend hours and hours on the phone, first with a line representative, and then with a “customer relations” employee. It is highly likely that Apple will lead you down the primrose path. After soft-soaping you for an hour or two on the phone, Apple will inevitably leave you hanging. If you want to start the complaint process all over again with a new Apple customer service employee, expect to have more of your time wasted and more empty promises.  And if you think you’re going to find more understanding and helpfulness at your local Apple Store, think again. They are as ineffectual, apathetic, and complacent as Apple’s phone support.  I’m in the market for a new computer. Before I go out and spend another $2500 on an Apple computer product I am going to remember all the trouble and bad service I’ve received on my $199.00 AirPods.  If Apple doesn’t take care of their customers somebody else will.

This review is for Apple Shopping Experience, not for an Apple Product.  Boy, am I disappointed with Apple. I ordered an iMac, FedEx attempted to deliver it today (Thursday), no one was home. I tried to have this held at FedEx so that I can pick it up tomorrow, negative says FedEx, Apple has restrictions on the delivery.  I got in touch with Apple, they said that this is the way it is. So, tomorrow Friday FedEx will try a new delivery, the attempt will be futile because there won't be anybody at home. You see, I work and I can't take an entire day sitting home while I wait for the FedEx truck.  If they would at least five me a time frame, then maybe I can work with that. So, Saturday they will try again, and guess what, I will not be home either. Basically Apple told me that FedEx has to make several delivery attempts before a ""hold-the-item-at-a-FedEx-location"" will kick into effect. That they said will be sometime next week.  So, you can understand how disappointed I am while the FedEx truck roams around town with my iMac that I wont be able to see for several days. I told the Apple representative that I was really frustrated by the situation, and that I felt extremely deceived by Apple for not advising customers of this kind of scenario.  I guess the Apple promise of FREE delivery is, well, delivery will take place sometime in the future.   Ricardo Arambarri Order # W952094471

I have been using mobile phones more than 20 years. Apple products are the only one I have had issues with. My main concern is the poor quality of the products although I could talk hours of the poorly designed interface and touchscreen.  Latest incident happened with the Ipad charger as it started smoking during Ipad charging and nearly ignited our curtains. I contacted customer support - which is by the way really difficult to find correct channel to complain - and as the guarantee was expired couple months ago they bluntly said that no reimbursements and have a good day. Needless to say that we only use original products but in Apple case it really doesn't matter if we would use some cheap China version.

Because I don't live anywhere close to an Apple store I mailed in my iPhone for trade in.  My 6S+ spent it's entire life in a protective case with an additional glass screen saver on it.  It was in perfect condition and could have been sold or given away and made someone very happy.  I mailed it in using the provided packaging materials; however, once it got to Apple's third party trade in partner, it magically had a bad screen that didn't work correctly.  Supposedly dead pixels and wavy lines.  Now, that could have happened during mailing but is that my fault?  They want to keep my phone and give me nothing.  Baloney!  This is a total scam and I warn you not to fall for their ""easy"" trade in line!!!!

We spent 6 hours with the Summit Mall store.  They kept my SIM card so after driving an hour to the store I couldn't even make a call.  Tried to call support . They tried to call the store for us. The phone actually rang for 22 minutes, 15 minutes the 16 minutes (yes we called back 3 times) and no on even answered the damn phone. YEP...never even answered.  The support people who tried to help us (wherever they are located) said they tried to call as well (and they work for this stupid Apple company).  Then they tried to call and said it even rang non-stop and couldn't get through.

Shocking customer service. Bought earphones for daughters Christmas and the wrong ones were sent. As they were wrapped up for Christmas the mistake wasn’t noticed till just under a month later. All I asked for was an exchange and the customer service agent Eto Kharanauli was rude and mocking telling me I should have noticed straight away and that they only do 14 days return even in the case of Christmas time.  I could understand if I was asking for a refund but an exchange costs them nothing. Will not purchase Apple again. If this is what they are like for a £58 order imagine what they email be like for more expensive items.

Worst customer service. Fake trials that charge tour account right away. Be careful of their fraud techniques.

I got a brand new sealed iPhone XS and lid extra for the FUNNY Apple care which I didn’t know it’s just a joke but my brand new phone has Face ID issue and Apple said we just replace the phone and not with a new sealed one, also we had this appointment in the Montgomery mall Bethesda Maryland and also talked with the manager who was a very rude person and got very bad attitude I am so sorry for Apple, don’t waste your money for this brand. And I forgot to tell that my wife and I collect money to buy this iPhone as a gift for a poor person who had cancer maybe we could make him happy. So angry and so sorry for Apple who doesn’t care customers.

Just bought a new bundle deal which included an iPod.  They locked my business acct and the only way to unlock it is to buy an Apple Card and give code and then they will refund your money.  This is a crock they can’t even unlock you acct with out you spending money..

If I could give them zero stars I would. My iPhone X that was only a year and a half old with no prior issues and suddenly got so hot it was burning my hands and ear when I tried to make a 1 minute phone call and then just stopped charging and only occasionally turned on. I called Apple to see what they could do about it and they said my only option was a nearly $700 repair. A $700 repair due to something completely out of my control. Not to mention I spent about 2 hours on the phone with them, most of it being on hold. I have had iPhones my entire life but after this I will never buy another apple product again. I refuse to pay money for a phone that is going to essentially just self destruct after a year.

Called customer service due to problems backing up on iCloud on iPhone and missing photos on my Mac and phone during backup attempt. After 7+ hours of going from one specialist to another and being to call back nothing has been resolved. And to make matters worse the last “senior” specialist I spoke to named Macy he became angry at my frustration to not want to repeat the same process he went on to hang up on me. I asked to speak to someone abobe him but he refused. I have always loved Apple products as I have 10 of their products. Needless to say I’m beyond disappointed in the poor customer service that Apple offers their customers. After this experience I have very little if any interest to continue to being an Apple customer.

I was a life long fan of Mac's, Iphones and everything to do with Apple. Now I find myself not buying  their products for two simple reason's. Their products no longer justify the premium cost and the backup has significantly dropped in recent years.  I'm switching everything to Samsung as I retire my Apple products over time. Recently I was in the convent garden shop and the Genius assistant tried to sell me a new battery for £49 pounds to replace a dead battery in a 14 month old iphone. No battery replacement as the battery is now considered a consumable component. Two major problems here. A. All Apple products including Iphones are sealed products, there's nothing you can replace on them, there's no consumables! its one sealed product. £49 to replace a battery a Samsung user can replace for £8. B. When I pointed this out and mentioned I would put the £49 towards a Samsung at half the price for the same spec, the Apple shop assistant looked at me as if I was a fool. You really need to take that type of reaction personally and give your money to another brand.  Hope this helps.

I am not happy with the iCloud tiers, my phone is having a 256 GB, but the tier is at 200 Gb, making me pay $8 if I go above 200.  Why are the iCloud tiers not aligned with the phone capacities?

For the last 3-4 years I have informed apple of their phishing emails and of course there’s been nothing but excuses. Well since I can’t remove my card information can you tell me how my card was charged for purchases I haven’t made? One for Apple Music on 12/30/2019, and today for tokens worth $49.99 that were shipped to an address for an iPhone 7 in red in California? I finally cancelled my storage subscription just so I could finally remove my card due to this!! Can anyone refer a good lawyer in Dallas TX!

Disgusting service. Need to security check their staff better!!!! If there was an option for no stars that would be my choice! Had my I phone 11 for just about 6 weeks and it kept switching off and back on my network could not help and I spoke to Apple who asked me to return the phone for repair. They sent me the “tamper proof” packaging to return the phone in. I followed the instructions and sealed the bag, it was then checked at the post office before posting and I watched it go in the post bag. I had heard nothing for a couple of weeks so got in touch with Apple and they informed me that the package had reached them empty and had not been tampered with upon receipt. I explained I had proof of posting, I had the weight of the parcel on the receipt showing it was not empty but they refused to accept it as proof I sent the phone back to them. I on the other hand am expected to take the word of an advisor that the person who opened the package was telling the truth and the package was empty despite my watching it go with my own eyes into the post bag with the phone inside! They cannot check any security footage to provide me with proof it was empty on receipt nor can they replace my phone as their staff recorded it on their system as empty!! Absolutely shocking customer service from a global company who have thousands of pounds of goods going through the depot but no means of checking security of customers goods is paramount 😡

I on November 22nd 2019 purchased iphone 11 pro max mobile, I found auto restart issue. Later I went to icare service center so they restored the device and gave back saying everything fixed and the very next day same thing continued again I visited service center, they kept my mobile for observation about 24 hrs they denied my complaint by saying no problem with device, gave me report stating all tests passed and told me to take a video if it gets restarts so that there will be proof (sounds very funny because I wont be holding my mob whenever it gets restarts) they also told me to contact iphone customer care they might help.... I followed, I explained the issue with customer care people they took nearly a week and said there is an ""hardware issue found in your device as per their internal team report"" so goto service center, I took an appointment by 3PM customer care girl told me that she will give me call same and tell service center people about the issue, at exactly 3PM she called me and disconnected immediately I don't know why, I was waiting at service center by that time hoping that she will call again but I got an email saying ""we tried calling you were unable to respond so we will call you in 24hrs"" I was surprised by the service by both service center and customer care, I was waiting in service center so i again called customer care and new person again I explained everything happened by this it was already4pm, she told that she will explain about the hardware issue to service center girl. Once I gave call to service center girl I don't know she disconnected what the hell was going on!!!!! again I contacted new customer care person same repeats..... service center guys just wanted a email confirmation about the hardware issue as they did not find it.. but they denied saying they can't send email but orally they can say, but these fellows told customer care people are giving fake promises we can't help at the end time was almost 6pm!!!!! I gave device there and they kept for observation I didn't understand what's the point of keeping my device for observation as they already got to know that there is an hardware issue?? I gave and showed the so called proof video of device getting restart and few pics reports... after 4 days they called me and told there is no problem with device I don't understand how these people making me fool and roam around these days it's so evident that there is problem with device but one will say there is hardware issue another says no your device is perfect I'm facing this issue I invested my money on defected piece and for that this is the response I get great I had lot of expectations but these people!!!!!! It's new phone and these issues and response freaking!!! Instead of replacing my phone they are making me fool!!!

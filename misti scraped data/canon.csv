                I bought a Canon  Pixma MG5750 inkjet printer for £44  at Currys' in early January 2020.<br/>Really low price, but really low quality. ultra-low quality of plastic used, so hinges snapped after a week. <br/><br/>Currys' gave me a refund without any hassle, and whilst I was there I bought Canon Prima TR7550 for  £60 <br/>Disadvantages-it is a discontinued model<br/>the inks are expensive, even the compatible brands <br/><br/>But, it is well made and performs well, so this gets 5*, as does Currys' staff.

                Canon sent me a faulty camera, and were adamant that no replacements or exchanges would be issued as per their terms and conditions. Customer service were rude and unhelpful. I bought direct from Canon as I assumed the item would be guaranteed, genuine, and the company would have great customer service. On top of that, refunds can take up to 30 days from when the item is returned, so I could be out of pocket by over £1000 for a month with no camera to show for it. I was completely wrong. Avoid, buy from somewhere with an exchanges/replacements policy!

                Good luck.  You can't even get ""help"" without them charging you $46/ month.   Asked for help to install software and set up my printer and I can't even ask a question without entering my %$*# card number.  I just bought the printer.  Now I have to pay just to ask an installation question?? are you kidding me!!!??  Will be returning this piece of $%*# product and my business will not be using Canon printers ever again.  This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

                The new Canon Pixima TS8150 which I was forced to buy because my older Canon printer (which was fine) needed something doing to it which the shop I use couldn't do as Canon had discontinued the software to allow them to repair it. (They were very apologetic).Just exactly how environmentally aware and responsible is that?!<br/>So this thing is a complete pain to use, completely un-user friendly, has all sorts of annoying ticks ( Do you want to retract the output tray? every time you turn it off!), the design is rubbish (whoever thought to put the swiveling info screen in a place so you can't see to feed a CD in nor the output tray either), why do I have to register the paper size every time I add paper? etc. etc.... <br/>And don't mention My Image Garden! Compared to the suite of facilities that used to exist, this is double-rubbish. You can only scan in PDF and JPEG and I challenge you to work out how to save an image in JPEG format! Click and Drag? - oh, no, that would be far too easy and obvious!! <br/>The times I have needed Customer Services, I have had no response at all about my enquiries. There doesn't seem to be any Forum for users to get help and aid. At this rate I will need blood pressure tablets any day now!<br/>And incidentally, I also have another Canon printer which I use with a non-Windows or Mac computer. It is a BJC-250. It works perfectly and always has done. Never broken down. I can get the ink for it no problem. It is now about 30years old!!! The Good Old Days. eh?!

                I have has 3 Canon printer... printING is OK....paper feed is cr@p.<br/>First printer had two paper trays - one at the rear &amp; one at the front - the front one NEVER worked.<br/>Second printer - the [only] back paper tray failed after about 1 year. Thanks to someone on Youtube and 1 1cm cube peice of sponge placed aloside the paper tray spring, it carried on for a few more years.<br/>Third printer [Caono TS3100] - Sometimes I would print 1 page but get 5 pages fed through the printer. After 14 months the paper feed started making grinding noises &amp; still getting extra blank sheets when printing. It then started making REALLY NASTY NOISES!!!! - like a washing maching throwing itself around the room. I checked for anything jammed...Nope...nothing...perfectly clear.  Bought another printer by a DIFFERENT manufacturer and the Canon is going in the bin...NEVER again ill i buy a canon...sorry...but why don't you test things??

                Second printer I've had with Canon and both have had issues. my printer was randomly missing out paper to print on which is not great as I need to print off double sided and it means the pages all end up mixed up. Contacted Canon support and was told even though my signal strength was a lot more than I needed I need to switch off my wifi. My wifi hub is not very accessible to me at time and when at the device I said; ""I've switched it off, I'll leave it a minute"" followed by ""OK I'm going to plug it back in."" Heard nothing off the person I was on the phone with. I get back to the printer and the adviser on the phone asks if the wifi is off yet. I couldn't stay calm so I said I had to go. This is the second printer I've had, the reason I had to buy this one is the old one needed one part replacing but Canon don't create that part as a spare part because without that part you can't use the printer/scanner at all. I put in a complain about them not producing the spare part but never heard anything back.

                My partner and I have, for a very long time, been very loyal customers to Canon  photographic equipment to the tune of £2000 so when we needed two printers we naturally went for Canon. <br/><br/>What a mistake!  Both devices recently died simultaneously through error Codes B203 and B200  (death of printer head.)<br/>When I rang to say how disappointed we were, I was told 'It was coincidental and we were lucky it lasted so long.' (Really? 3 years is long?)<br/>When I mentioned the huge number of negative reviews on this issue I was told that I had probably only read a few. They seemed surprised that I had read all 111!<br/>We were  told that one printer was discontinued and that the other might be repaired, but that it would be cheaper to buy a new device. We were also told that it would be difficult to find printers compatible to one of ours and that the only solution would be for us to  buy another PC!<br/>I said 'So we now have to buy one PC and two printers for the sake of a clear design fault on your part?'<br/><br/>Eventually we were offered a 20%  and then 30% voucher towards new printers to be spent in Canon's  online shop. We were not informed that there  was a limit on the kind of printers we could have and when asked they gave us a list of 24 printers (higher end) that were not open to us and therefore would not be able to replace our own higher end printers .<br/>They said that the offer was their standard procedure and they could do no more. When I said that I would therefore walk away and would never recommend Canon, they didn't appear in the least concerned.The only reason why I gave any star at all is the fact that individuals were not actually outright rude and and the fault lies entirely with the company.

                Bought a canon isensys with a 3 year warranty - experienced terrible print quality issues after 1 year of normal use - wanted to claim on the warranty and have now been waiting for 11 days to get a decision whether canon will honor the warranty - Canon put us on to an external repair and service  partner who refused to reply and had to be chased - after a week they sent an engineer who merely confirmed what we already know ie there was a problem - he didnt fix it and said that it would need an off site repair and the service engineers would get back to us - we chased the service engineers twice and are being told that they still don't know if it covered by the warranty and we will have to wait!!!!! I have called the Canon CS number  c 8 times and have insisted that I be escalated to a manager who can give me a decision - not ONCE have i been called back. It is now almost 2 weeks sorting this issue out and we are no further forward in getting a repair. When i call canon UK the receptionists tell me that the CEO UK doesnt accept external calls ! They dont have any idea of an individual who is in charge of customer services - its a total frustration getting canon to even speak to us let alone fix our printer !! When working the printer was ok but this customer services organisation is the worst that I have ever experienced - totally unresponsive and unsympathetic to  their customers needs - when a printer goes wrong it needs to be fixed quickly - its an essential tool these days. This is the second isensys that has gone wrong within a year and my fear is the reliability and longevity is just not there. If you are thinking of buying one please remember that you will - at some stage - want to use their service/repair/warranty capability and in our experience it is truly woeful - doesn't even deserve 1 star - buyers beware

                Right, let me first of all say that my experience with Canon UK (and by that I mean the official store!) was utterly faultless. <br/><br/>I made an order for a lens on a Thursday at 11am and recieved order confirmation immediately. <br/><br/>On Monday morning recieved an email from UPS saying delivery would be by the end of that day - the lens was delivered at 12pm midday.<br/><br/>I have to question whether or not these reviews are real, yes I know there are too many to be fake but why is this review page STILL unclaimed by Canon? Why have they not replied or responded to any of these reviews? <br/><br/>Please understand that Canon are of course not perfect, but they ARE a huge huge company selling fantastic cameras and lenses so you should of course be confident and relaxed when making a purchase.

                I have had problems with my pro-100s for months which the customer service advisor couldn't fix and which I was sent to 2nd their customer services for. I sent a detailed email with screenshots of settings and prints not matching etc. and had nothing back. I sent the emails again from a trusted account that I use on a daily basis, but nothing !<br/><br/> When I finally called up again I was told they couldn't help me as my case was already with 2nd tier and I needed to send the email again ! The 2nd tier eventually called my back after a few calls I couldn't get and took me through some settings. I am now out of ink after countless prints that weren't matching in colour and printing the wrong scale on the media selected. In short, I can't test whether my printer is now working as I have no ink left and Canon refused to send me a set of cartridges, despite the appalling service I've had. If you are looking for a printer, I'd stay clear of Canon as I've had countless problems with this printer and terrible service from Canon UK customer services.

                Be very careful if you choose to do a Firmware update!<br/><br/>I opted to update the firmware on my canon camera, exactly as all of these manufacturers recommend you to do.<br/><br/>I followed the instructions exactly, to the letter.  Well it totally bricked my camera.  The only option was for it to go back to Canon and unbelievably they ended up replacing the main board in the camera.  They wanted to take no responsibility for it at all and kept repeating that you update at your own risk and sign disclaimer when downloading the software.  Well Canon, your software is NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE if it is capable of destroying a cameras main board!!<br/>They charged me almost £200 to fix the camera and that was after me arguing my case and being offered a discount.<br/><br/>After spending thousands on Canon equipment, this has left a very sour taste.  I can assure you it will be the last Canon purchase if that's how you treat customers.  It's the tone of arrogance that you get from the staff that really annoyed me.  That 'not our problem' type of response when you ask them for help.  Very poor service from a brand I had trusted for years.

                The worst 'shopping' experience and customer service experience I have had in my entire life. I bought a new camera for work, Canon took my money, the item didn't arrive. They told me apparently it MIGHT have gotten lost and that I have to wait for 'an investigation'. This might mean the item MIGHT arrive 4 weeks after Canon took my money - MAYBE. I would NEVER have bought the item if I knew it would arrive almost a month later! I would have gone to Amazon. I bought this for work and every day is costing me. Canon basically just shrug, oh well. No refund. No explanation. No support.

                Well Thank You Canon! <br/>Like most Mac owners I am now running their latest operating system - Catalina. Apart from a few hiccups, it's great. <br/>HOWEVER - on trying to update drivers for my printer I am very kindly advised by Canon that my Pixma MG6250 printer does not support Apple Catalina OS - but I can pick another printer from their range to purchase! My printer is not old, is in excellent condition and works - or did work - fine.<br/>So thank you very much Canon - I won't be buying anything from you again!

                Canon OnLine store didn't apply the 20% discount code they'd emailed me. The onLine Store ordering page actioned the camera (Ivy Rec) order without the discount. Canon admitted their systems weren't working properly. Only option was to send the delivery back and get a refund. Then re-order using the updated system. This was a product I wanted to buy, and actually had in my hands, but Canon couldn't refund the missing discount, so I had to return it. Madness. Needless to say, I'm not using the OnLine Store again. Canon: Why have a sophisticated mailing system with discount offers etc. but such a prehistoric order system? Get that sorted first, before unleashing your web marketing geniuses.

                I got my Canon printer due to my disabled students allowance, and wouldn't have picked getting a printer from this company if I had a choice.<br/><br/>The main problem with this printer is that it's been programmed to waste the coloured inks to print black, if you print a document in colour. So, even if you have a tiny image in colour, all the rest of the print work will be done combining the other coloured inks to make black, rather than using one of the two black inks the printer has.<br/><br/>This makes printer extremely wasteful, I've hone through 5 packs of inks and not even halfway through a pack of 500 sheets of printer paper. When the inks are £50+ for a set of Canon inks, this is ridiculously expensive.<br/><br/>They've clearly programmed the printer to ignored the two black inks whenever you print something in the colour setting, in order to force their customers to buy there inks far more frequently than they'd be needed if they'd been programmed to always use one of the two black inks to print black, even when using the coloured printing option.<br/><br/>Avoid buying printers from this company, they will rip you off to make money from ink sales

                Bought a Canon MG5750 printer in June 2017. It has now completely failed, probably a software issue, and displays the messsage, ""Support Code 1403, The type of printer head is incorrect. Install the correct printer head"". I've removed and thoroughly cleaned the printer head, as per numerous YouTube videos, but the error persists. I've only used the printer for occasional use. The print quality was always poor and now product reliablity has proven to be abysmal. I've binned it for a more reliable make and I shall never buy another Canon product again!

                I attempted to buy a Canon M50 camera from the Canon Online Shop whilst away from home on holiday in Norfolk. I followed the webpage instructions implicitly but when I came to the payment section the Canon webpage system repeatedly crashed for what appeared no reason. I thought it may have been the bank card that was being refused as my cards had recently been replaced with new ones so I rang my bank. They confirmed that Canon was taking the money from my account but almost instantly was returning the money to my account for no reason that they could determine. They assured me that it was not the bank blocking the payment and I therefore needed to contact Canon. I tried ringing Canon several times but could not get beyond listening to never ending messages about how busy they were. I then tried ordering the camera again and it worked perfectly and stated the camera would be delivered in two days time. I automatically thought they must have had a glitch which had been rectified. I then left to go to John Lewis store in Norwich to buy a lens adapter for the camera which was about £30 cheaper than buying it from Canon with the camera! When I came to pay for the adapter I found my bank card was refused which rather stunned me. I tried credit card from the same bank and that was also refused. I then tried my wife's bank card and that was refused. Embarrassingly I was forced to go to the bank to find out what was going on. I found at the bank that Canon had returned the payment 1 hour after taking it and cancelled my order of the camera and stopped its delivery. This action coupled with with the earlier refusals by Canon had caused the bank systems to think illegal transactions were been attempted and automatically closed all my accounts and stopped my bank cards! Fortunately I had gone to the bank in person  and they were able to immediately clear all stops and reactivate all the accounts and cards. At no time during all this did Canon ever get in touch with me to tell me what they were doing, why they were doing it or ask for further information from me about my attempts to buy a camera from them. I therefore then went to the local Norwich PcWorld/Currys and bought the camera over the counter for the same price as Canon (there was a £150 discount offer at the time from Canon). I was annoyed with Canon as I had had an extremely stressful and embarrassing day whilst on holiday. I wrote an email to Canon Service to let them know what they had put me through and expected to get some form of apology. I only got the explanation that their system had noticed that the delivery address on my order was different from my home address in shown in records from earlier purchases over the years. I pointed out that their system did not ask at any time for my home address and when I put in my son's address in Norwich as the delivery address it did not query it, it did not flag up a problem, it merely continued to the payment section of the system which to start with had accepted the card details 3 times and then crashed without explanation but then later accepted the same details fully. I have written several emails and each one has been replied to by saying it was completely my fault, their systems are there to protect me from fraudulent attempts of bank card scams, etc. etc. They refuse to accept any blame for the stress and embarrassment they put me through and make it quite clear they will not entertain any possibility that their system was at fault. Life is to short to continue the argument with Canon so I have demanded they remove all trace of me from their records with an emphasis on their knowledge of my bank details as I simply do not trust or respect them as company. This is very sad for me as I have bought many Canon cameras, lenses and printers since my first Canon SLR EOS 600 in 1986 but now I have the distinct feeling that if you have a problem with them or their products they are not interested in the slightest.Goodbye Canon.

                My Canon MG7150 printer stopped working and displayed an error code. When I contacted Canon support, I was informed that the error code meant the printer had an internal fault which would be very expensive to repair and I'd be better purchasing a new printer. They ""helpfully"" gave me a 30% discount code, BUT only to be used at Canon's online store. I wasn't satisfied with this and did a bit of rooting around on the internet to discover the fault code indicated a simple paper jam that I cleared in a couple of minutes! I don't know if this was a genuine error by the support team, a rogue individual scamming to increase commission, or scamming at a corporate scale, but whatever it is, it was an appalling episode and Canon should be ashamed. It wasn't so much the cost of buying a new printer that concerned me, as the waste of all the embodied energy and carbon that would have been jettisoned had I taken Canon's advice to through away a perfectly serviceable printer!

                Very disappointed with Canon Warranty procedures. Bought my printer online last year. Order was processed on Sept 8, 2018, shipped on September 11, 2018  and item was received on September 15, 2018. I have documentary proof of all dates. Placed a service call on September 9, 2019 and was told that the item was out of Warranty since the invoice date was September 8, 2018!!!! Also the online manual is worthless! I called Canon customer support yesterday to figure out how to darken the print copies and they wouldn't help me! Canon has lost a customer for life. Neither I nor anyone in my family/friends will ever buy another Canon product EVER!!

                The mirror in my Canon 5Dfell off during a photoshoot. I contacted Canon and found out my camera had a recall for this issue. I asked to send it in to be fixed, and they said they could not do that for me, but they could offer me an upgrade. They then quoted me $3,000 for an upgraded camera. I wasn't prepared for my mirror falling out, therefore I didn't save up 3 grand for a new canera. They made it seem like it couldn't be repaired. A photographer friend send me a link to a youtube video, and $5.62 later my camera is good as new. That was horrible customer service. Really quite unhappy about how they wouldn't take ownership for this recall and fix it. I spend too much money for them to treat me like this.

                Bought a Canon PowerShot SX720HS camera in June of 2018 and took pictures in August and November.  Tried to open the camera in August of this year and the camera would not open.  Had the battery checked and replaced and it still would not open.  Sent the camera to Canon to look at and they said they could not fix the camera and offered a replacement for $180.00.  I paid $280 originally. I realize it was 3 months beyond the 1 year warranty, but I found their response inadequate.  I will NEVER buy a Canon camera again!!

                Bought a Canon mf 264 dw laser printer/scanner that almost always  returned error messages.<br/>The few times it worked , it produced documents of low quality.<br/>Assistance was terrible. First level kind but inadequate. So called second level almost impossible to reach. After one month wasting time, it was sadly cheaper to just throw to the garbage the lemon I picked and buy a different brand. Never more Canon in the future..

                I bought a printer, ALL IN ONE. The printer does not have the ability to scan more than one page at a time. What a kind of company makes a printer that is named all in one but does not allow a person to scan a resume of multiple pages. What piece of garbage. Canon TS5120. is a bad buy and Canon's research people failed to test this devise in the real world. Am I suppose to make 10 different PDF files for one 10 page document? What an idiotic design. The printer has a rear feed but instead of making that the automatic document feeder they made it a second place to put copy paper. So disappointed in this company

                I bought a canon sx730 in november. The retracting lens cover kept sticking. I sent it back to canon after a telephone conversation with them. Apparently they sent it to Germany to be repaired. The report from Germany said the camera had been dropped so the warranty was void. I disputed this over the telephone with the uk branch. They said they would send a replacement which they did. Thank you.

                I bought a Canon PowerShot SX620 HS in March 2019.<br/>Within 4 months, the retracting lens got stuck.<br/>I was on holiday and I could not place the camera in its case anymore. When I flown back to England, the camera got a chip.<br/>Upon my return, I called the customer service where I bought the camera and I was invited to bring the camera to the store. They took it for repair.<br/>However, when I called to get some update with the repair, I learned that even though I bought the camera 4 months ago, I lost the guarantee because of the chip.<br/>I explained that the chip happened because the retracting lens was stuck but it doesn't matter.<br/>CANON rejects all warranties by saying that the clients lose the warranty if there is a physical damage on the electrical device.<br/>Ok, I lost the warranty so I asked about the repair.<br/>I was told they won't repair and the repair centre offered to replace my camera for almost the same price I bought it 4 months ago. Why should I buy again a camera that failed me?<br/>As I did not intent to buy a new camera, I ask about the possibility of repair.<br/>Then the customer service assistant explained to me that CANON  does not repair anything anymore. THEY HAVE OUTSOURCED their repair centres.<br/>To simplify the process, CANON does not have any repair facilities anymore, they just focuss on selling.<br/>When a device is broken, it is sent to one of the outsource repair centres.<br/>If the device is under warranty, CANON is charged for the repair. If the device is not under warranty, the client is charged for the repair.<br/>CANON does not want to lose money so take as little responsibilities as possible and it works well when everybody loses their warranty if there is a single physical damage. You have a chip and you're done! You just lost your warranty.<br/>The outsource repair centres are there to earn money as fast as possible.<br/>In my case, they simply offered me to replace the product at the same price I purchased it. Like this, they don't have to pay for new pieces, don't spend time in repair, just sell you the same thing you already have and tell you to bin your camera.<br/>When I explained again that the camera was new, which means that  all the components were new and that only the lens had an issue, they said that it was too expensive to fix and they have to discard it and that I need to buy a new one.<br/>CONCLUSION: I was told to threw my camera away and buy a new one.<br/>All their devices are simply treated as pieces of junk.<br/>If your device breaks, you are likely to be told to threw it away.<br/>CANON LOOKS FOR PROFIT, NEGLECTS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND POLLUTE THE PLANET.<br/>Avoid this kind of companies that don't care about the environment.

                Printer performs ok, but the ink usage and cost is extortionate.<br/>Two problems - Firstly, the printer cleans its print head virtually continuously, even before and after printing a single full stop.<br/>Secondly, All colours in a single cartridge, plus separate black cartridge which together cost more than a new printer that comes with cartridges.<br/>I've printed about 6 A4 colour pics and cartridge nearly empty.

                canon rp - complete waste of money. i am in the process of returning the camera as it was bought through a rd party seller, but i will probably lose some money from postal return.<br/><br/>I bought the camera as option to be silent against my 5D mark IV which i can only use in a sound blimp and only on fully automatic as my blimp has no access to the dials when closed. <br/><br/>When the camera arrived in the manual it says silent mode but doesn't explain anything about silent mode. So i phoned canon. I asked how can i get into silent mode and they said i had to turn the main dial to SCN and then scroll down on the viewer to mute sound. Great i thought - don't know how this wasn't explained in the manual. While still speaking to the customer service agent it becomes i apparent i can't change any settings and this silent mode is fully automatic. The customer service agent doesn't know and i am put on hold. The line goes dead. I phone back. again i ask the question and again i am put on hold. this time the person comes back to me and say yes unfortunately it is only fully automatic. So this means i have spent money on something i can do already. Why would any mode on a expensive camera be only automatic??? Give me the choice. let me choose what is my priority the camera doesn't know what i am trying to achieve and what my plan is. I complained. I have just had a phone call back from them. They apologised and said having silent on fully automatic was a business decision and could not justify why it wasn't on manual. He would send my comments on to canon, but lets be honest that means nothing. when will canon realise they are so behind the times on mirrorless, that adding features that are they quite unusuable you are charging too much for poor features. The person i spoke to said we do have a silent one, but it is £1,500 more expensive than the flawed RP, for that one extra feature. I only chose canon because i have lots of canon lens so using a converter would save me money overall buying new lens with a different mirrorless. In my mind the benefits of a mirrorless against a dslr should be weight and quietness, all other extras are a plus and some are nice but not essential if you have a high end dslr.<br/>It seems canon arrogance is getting to mirrorless late, advertising features incorrectly and charging as much as the high end mirrorless, that aren't even worth half the price.<br/><br/>My view unless canon sort themselves out soon they are not the company to buy cameras from anymore. And have never been for mirrorless as they aren't in touch with real peoples needs unless money is no object and you are happy to spend money on overpriced substandard devices.

                I have a 9 month old Canon Pixma TS5050 which, up until now has been temperamental, but has worked.<br/>Have used (quality) remanufactured cartridges since new owing to eye-watering cost of originals. Printer recognises all the cartridges, displays the ink levels, but has suddenly decided not to print using Cyan cartridge. Tried all recommended cleaning &amp; alignement processes, no error messages, but that colour still missing.<br/>Canon solution? It's the ink density (all of a sudden!) - buy one of our mega expensive cartridges &amp; all will be OK. No other possible solution available. By the way - reject the printer &amp; unless all the cartridges are Canon Originals, the warranty is void.<br/>It is actually economically viable to junk it &amp; buy a new printer rather than purchase Canon Cartridges.

                I recently bought an expensive Canon Speedlite 470ex-ai the rrp is £499. Imagine my disdain, when I find that it’s key feature Ai Bounce and the fully automated flash function, was a completely useless marketing gimmick, designed to push beginners and enthusiasts into buying 2 different cameras. The Canon 6D Mark ii and an older camera, The EOS-1D Mark N which is an 8 megapixel full frame camera released in 2004. I own a 2000D released last year and it doesn’t work with this model. Why not? I complained about this to Canon only to receive a vacant reply.<br/><br/>Here is what they said, ‘Thank you for your request and for contacting Canon.<br/><br/>We are really sorry to learn you are did not like the functionality of your 470EX-AI. I would like to let you know that this specific model does support the AI Bounce full-auto mode on specific Canon Camera models, however EOS 2000D does not support this. This is due to marketing and production reasons.<br/><br/>We are really sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused and we are at your disposal should you need anything else.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you for contacting Canon Services &amp; Support. We hope that the above information is of use to you.<br/><br/>However, it’s almost as if they completely missed the point. I just like everyone else that made this mistake, needed a workaround, a solution, not useless excuses. Clearly, Canon is just another faceless corporate entity, cynically seeing it’s customers as stupid, ignorant cash cows, with no intelligence and empty pockets. The absolute stupidity, of this decision can be likened to making one interchangeable lens, just to fit one particular camera. I can see that with the type of marketing and production logic, applied to the 470 ex-ai, this will be what they’ll be telling us in a few years.<br/><br/>As a beginner, I thoroughly regret choosing Canon instead of choosing another camera manufacturer and see buying into the Canon ecosystem as a big mistake.

                I recently experienced trouble with a Canon 1.4x extender mk3 where it would not unlock from my Canon 500mm f4 prime lens. The unlocking switch would move but it would not come off the lens. Eventually after some rocking of the extender it came off with a little effort. I was receiving err 01 messages on the camera which indicated the camera and lens were not communicating and as the extender was between the two the assumed cause. The extender had to be removed to allow for the camera and lens to continue to be used. <br/>Later the camera and extender were reattached so I could try it all out after cleaning the connectors however the camera rolled off of the lens and smashed on the ground damaging beyond use the LCD. <br/>The camera has gone through my insurers but the extender has gone to Canon UK for repair as I found that no matter what I did it would now not lock onto the lens, the outer housing will rotate. <br/>Canon have blamed my for damaging the extender ( the outer housing rotation) and insist I pay for the repair however this is unacceptable as the initial issue was with the extender not coming off the lens in the first place, i.e. it was not doing what it should have done and I was using it as an extender should be used. The damage was as a result of getting it off. Granted the damage to house may have been caused by me removing the extender but If the extender had done what it was meant to do in the first instance there would have been A) no damage to extender housing and B) damage to my camera's LCD resulting in extended period of time with out it. <br/>Canon are blinkered to the fact the issue was in the very first instance down to the extender locking onto the lens and I have been quoted 'it's outside of warranty (it's only 2 years old but only comes with 1 years warranty which says a lot; Canon probably know its poorly made and expect money out of future repairs), damage to the housing as a result of getting off the lens. <br/>As it was outside of warranty I was happy to pay the standard repair cost but now wanting me to pay for the damage that would not have occurred for the above reasons. These things are not cheap and I would expect it last a lot longer than the 4 months or so use over the period of 2 years that I have had it, It spends most of the time in the camera bag. <br/>I can see why a lot of Canon users are moving to Nikon and after being a 20year Canon user this level of customer service will make me consider jumping to Canon's rivals as well.

                I purchased a brand new TS9551C printer from the Canon Store but it was faulty when delivered. I would have liked to exchange it but I was told I had to return the faulty one for a refund before I would then be able to order a new one. Canon arranged a courier to collect the item but their appointed courier failed to show up on the first 2 times I waited in so it took 3 attempts to get it collected. A complete nightmare given Canon would only offer a weekday collection from 8am-6pm and despite my repeated pleas after the first 2 failed attempts would not offer a priority service, allow me to leave it out for the courier or send it back on my own. I finally managed to get the printer returned but several days later there was no sign of my refund. When I contacted Canon they told me they need to send the printer on to their warehouse in Germany for inspection before they can then issue the refund.They sent me a broken printer, I've returned and they still have my money! Every time I try and speak to customer services they are rude and unhelpful. The call centre handlers obviously have a very tight script they are not allowed to deviate from and show absolutely no empathy for the difficult position they put their customers in. I have been a Canon customer for cameras and printers for over 20 years but as a result of this experience I will NEVER purchase from them again. If you are considering purchasing a Canon product I would strongly recommend you use a different retailer who understands what proper customer service should look like.

After my 70D was diagnosed with a known problem to this model they took it back and repaired it within a few days. I was not charged and received the camera back safely packaged securely simple as that. Very pleased with the outcome.

                I felt obligated to write a review. I have a very inexpensive canon pixma printer. Cost me about $40 on Amazon. Few months ago it wasnt working properly and I called the Canon support line. The rep was very patient and helpful and determined that it couldnt be fixed and he shipped me a new one for free. <br/><br/>Today, that printer stopped working correctly and the paper kept getting jammed inside. I called the support line again and the rep was also very helpful, walked me through a few steps, and within about 15 minutes we had it working again. <br/><br/>I have to say that I a very pleased with canon's support.

                In the last 2 years I have owned 2 Canon Printers, an MG5650 which  failed just out of warranty, which would only print A5 if it felt like it, and an MG3050 purchased in November 2018, which ate ink &amp; missed pages. The assistance from Canon support was useless, &amp; I ditched both printers, despite the latter still being under warranty.<br/>I have since purchased an HP printer which is in a totally different quality league.<br/>The Canon products were unreliable &amp; their customer service absolutely appalling!

                Canon MG 3600! This has to be the worse printer I have ever owned! Ever since I have had it 6 months ago, it’s been one problem after the other, unreliable and useless, the ink ran out after a month, I don’t use it often, it cost me almost £50 for refills! More than the printer, I get continuous  flashing lights, every time I use it, it’s just not worth the effort, go for a Brother, at least they work and are so reliable, never ever ever again! This is going in the round top filing cabinet aka the bin!

                I purchased a brand new TS9551C printer from the Canon Store but it was faulty when delivered. I would have liked to exchange it but I was told I had to return the faulty one for a refund before I would then be able to order a new one. Canon arranged a courier to collect the item but their appointed courier failed to show up on the first 2 times I waited in so it took 3 attempts to get it collected. A complete nightmare given Canon would only offer a weekday collection from 8am-6pm and despite my repeated pleas after the first 2 failed attempts would not offer a priority service, allow me to leave it out for the courier or send it back on my own. I finally managed to get the printer returned but several days later there was no sign of my refund. When I contacted Canon they told me they need to send the printer on to their warehouse in Germany for inspection before they can then issue the refund.They sent me a broken printer, I've returned and they still have my money! Every time I try and speak to customer services they are rude and unhelpful. The call centre handlers obviously have a very tight script they are not allowed to deviate from and show absolutely no empathy for the difficult position they put their customers in. I have been a Canon customer for cameras and printers for over 20 years but as a result of this experience I will NEVER purchase from them again. If you are considering purchasing a Canon product I would strongly recommend you use a different retailer who understands what proper customer service should look like.

                Dreadful, patronising, customer service!<br/><br/>Edited 15 February 2019 to add - When I telephoned them, they really did not care that the item which should have been delivered had, by mistake, been taken back to the carrier's warehouse.  Despite having two emails from the carriers that the item would be delivered that day, all Canon would say is that delivery can take 3-5 days.  Like banging my head against a brick wall.

                Needed help to put printer on line. I was told I needed some IP protection software for $190 to get this $40 printer on line. Then dropped the price to $90 when he learned I was 76 years old. I declined and found the simple solution on line. All that was needed was to locate and delete a check mark labeled  ""use printer off line"". Works fine now. I didn't know Canon was a shyster operation. I'll stick with HP from now on.

                I love their products, but Canon's rebate policy is not good.  I wish they would provide instant rebates during purchase, instead customers need to mail it in by a provided date.  I moved and delivered my 5th baby boy, so I did not send it in on time.  Canon would not honor the rebate.  I purchased a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV DSLR Camera with 24-105mm f/4L II Lens <br/>for $3,999.00 and only purchased a printer with it because the rebate offered when purchased together.  I lost $250.

                I have a Canon Maxify MB5455 multi function printer that developed a fault after 14 months of light use.  I had the extended 'exchange warranty' which meant the printer was still covered by warranty. I reported the problem to canon who required the original receipt to validate my warranty and then they arranged for a replacement (exchange) printer to be sent.  Although this all took about a week I received the replacement printer. Once set up this 'new' printer immediately displayed an error message and would not work. After calling the support line once again it was established that the printer has a fault that could not be fixed by me. This printer was returned and yet another 'replacement/exchange' printer was sent out which, although two days later than promised, arrived 10 days after my initial complaint. On setting up this new-2nd exchange/replacement printer it also displayed the same fault message as the two previous printers. After numerous calls and emails Canon finally agreed to send me a new printer which arrived today (more than three weeks after my first call) and after set up worked as it should do.<br/><br/>Canon clearly have many many issues, both product quality, process issues, staff issues, management issues and logistics issues all of which demonstrates a company that does not care for or look after its customers. Each person I spoke to was pleasant and seemed to understand and agree with my frustration but, despite this, it is clear that the whole process is broken as is the loyalty of many of their customers - like me. Just read the other Truspilot reviews on Canon. Very sad state of affairs. Bye bye Canon.

Which is sad, as they used to be sooo good in my opinion.<br/><br/>I have recently HAD to buy a new printer from them because that very common PRINTHEAD mystery problem popped up with my nearly new, well 18 month old printer!  Other than that this printer worked fine.<br/><br/>So I purchase the all new updated compact nice looking printer of theirs called the MG5750 which is also wireless.<br/><br/>And boy, have I had so many connectivity and operational issues with it! If it does connect, then there's another problem, the printer says it's out of paper. I go upstairs to check, and lo and behold, the tray has ample amounts of paper! <br/><br/>So many times when I try to print it either doesn't connect or says the printer is in use or some other error which stops it from printing, then it decides to print 2 days later what I sent to it!<br/><br/>ABSOLUTE RUBBISH when you're trying to run a business! I aint got time for Canon crap!<br/><br/>Change your ways or millions will change theirs and jump from this seemingly sinking ship!  Seems like a cannon ball has blasted a hole right through this ship, and it's sinking in terrible untested products and poor quality functions!<br/><br/>I also recently purchase a video camera, which is not being used, because their AP doesn't work properly!

                While in general my printer has worked well, I have a big issue with my experience with Canon customer service. I called asking for help to set up my wireless printer on a new network, since no instructions could be found online. Instead of trouble shooting with me, the representative immediately asked to take control of my computer screen. Before making any attempt to connect my printer to the wireless network he pulls up some screen and starts talking about how my computer has ""hackers"" that have messed up my printer. Tries to talk me into paying $400 to be connected to someone remove them and ""re-intall software"". He refused to provide me with the number he was going to connect me to, and when I declined this service, he hung up on me. I ran my anti-malware software - which found NO threats/issues on my computer. Then spend another 40 minutes troubleshooting by myself and was able to connect the printer and get it to work again. I'm very disappointing with this companies ""customer service"" and glad I didn't get conned into spending all that money on nothing.

                Having bought Canon products before I confidently bought a Powershot SX720 HS camera recently. Massive mistake. Unfortunately the future is wireless and the camera is supposed to connect to other devices to download the photos, but sadly it fails to do this. Canon's own technical support were unable to do it, but took 45 minutes to talk me through the instructions I had followed myself online only for them to discover it doesn't work for them either. They offered to escalate the issue but that support was less than useless, sending woefully inadequate instructions and referring me back to the instructions they themselves confirmed didn't work. The only option? Take a day off work and wait in for a call (as they only work 8.30 - 15.30 Mon- Friday, despite opening hours being until 20.00) or buy an interface cable at extra cost. No thanks, I will be getting a refund and steering clear of Canon in the future

                For context, I use this DSLR camera for Youtube videos mainly.<br/><br/>I originally bought a Canon 80D despite having doubts, the video footage never looked that sharp to me. That said, after trying it myself I wasn't happy with it so sent it back.<br/><br/>When looking for an alternative, many were saying the 6D 2 was too similar but a lot more expensive. I disagree, for me the video footage of the 6d 2 is a lot sharper and generally a lot better out of the box. No need to sharpen in post production.<br/><br/>Happy with the purchase. Overall this is my second Canon camera. Never had to contact support so don't know how good they are (bought and refunded my 80D via Amazon), but overall can't complain with the Canon experience.

                I'm a professional photographer, so I'm not new to photography or print quality. Bought a Pixma Pro-10s which is supposed to be a pro-level photo printer. What I got was a machine that didn't operate correctly from day one. Wasted days, weeks and months trying to get Canon UK and Ireland to listen. They asked the same questions over and over, asked me to make the same test prints over and over, and then tried to tell me there was nothing wrong with my £530 investment that was producing shockingly poor prints. They eventually took it back and replaced it, cuz it was indeed faulty. Now machine No2 has developed a very similar fault and guess what? Yep, they couldn't care less. Well Canon, as I told you via twitter, here's the first of an epic list of reviews to go public. You get the review you deserve, and if I could give ZERO I would!

                Bought a Canon MG5750 All In One printer three weeks ago, the ink tanks are now empty.... and I haven't even printed one single character....<br/>Every time I turn it on to scan a document to my PC it cleans the print heads, so now £60 of ink has been completely wasted.<br/>I messaged Canon for a solution, they told me that the printer will clean the heads every time you turn it on, and again a few minutes after you print anything, even one character, it will clean itself !!!!!<br/>I asked them if the auto clean function could be turned off, as I am sure most people are clever enough to see when the printer heads needed cleaning from what they can see on the printed page, so why can't there be a setting to turn off the auto clean and the user to manually run a clean cycle when needed.<br/>They said 'that's the way it is' and it can't be turned off.<br/>They suggested that I '' Leave the printer switched on 24/7 '' as then it wouldn't waste as much ink as it would be in stand by !!!!<br/>When I suggested that as a company who supposedly cared for the environment, this was a completely ludicrous statement, and would only lead to energy being wasted for zero need, guess what, they never replied.<br/>Anyway, from this I have concluded that Canon do not care about the customer or the environment, and the Auto clean setting is there just to waste ink, thus potentially making more profit for themselves.<br/><br/>I would comment on whether the print quality was any good, but I have no ink left to print anything.<br/><br/>This will be the last Canon product I will ever buy.

                We purchased a Canon Legria HF R806 camcorder, back in January 2018, and also at the same time, a Canon Ixus 190 camera. We needed to know how to edit the movies we take to save to disk or hard drive, as there was no software included to allow this to be done. After several emails to Canon we got no response at all offering any help with this problem. The Ixus camera battery which was supposed to take about 190 photos on one charge gave up after 15 photos and had to be recharged. The main concern  is the fact that Canon offer £35 cashback on the Legria Camcorder, however don't be tempted by this offer it is false. I applied three times and all they do is keep coming up with excuses but no sign of the cash. My advice: stick to Japanese electronics they are much more reliable.

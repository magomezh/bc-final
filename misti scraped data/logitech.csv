Awful....Useless...Disgusting .......Shall I go on? Dumb enough to order an expensive Mic from this bunch of cowboys. Was told 4-7 days dispatch. It's been nine already and I have heard nothing, no email, no contact..nothing. Rang the most complicated Customer Support line in the world yesterday and was told maximum 24-hour comeback...Guess what? Twenty-seven hours later, no contact and now they are shut for the weekend... AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Impossible to cancel the order from the website. Very disappointed! Logitech is running their business with a very weird perspective. Time will teach them the lesson.  Avoid supporting this company at all costs. Money has to go to companies that take care of costumers and provides a respectable relationship and even more when difficult time’s arises. Now they show what they really are. Makeup.

  I order a iPad Air 2 keyboard case for £14.99 it magnetically connects to my ipad and really helps me do my school work and things i enjoy. I would recommend this keyboard case to anyone that has an iPad that cant afford a laptop who does school work. This keyboard is really good for getting work done quickly Battery life is AMAZING

  AVOID these cowboys. Tried to buy a webcam direct from Logitech.com. Quickly got an email confirming my order and confirmation from PayPal that they'd taken my money (£99). Then silence. The webcam was in stock when ordered, so a week later I was wondering why it hadn't arrived. So I sent messages to Logitech and to Digital River, their agent. No response. Rang Digital River twice, they apparently could see my order but were, and I quote 'not allowed to get involved in Logitech stuff'. Finally after a long search I found a number for Logitech in the UK and got through to a guy who could help. He told me that my order was at least 2 weeks away from being shipped, and that was not guaranteed. Likely if anything to be longer. I pointed out that I'd ordered the item as in stock and my money had been taken. No explanation. So I've had to cancel my order and buy a different product. Well done Logitech. AVOID these cowboys.

  if I could give this &lt;1 star I would...I've had nothing but problems and Logitech has continually put me off until the product is no longer under warranty. The keyboard stopped working a few months after I got the product. I contacted them and we were able to get it to work again although intermittently. After continued frustration with the reset process I contacted Logitech, went through the whole list of steps again and cannot get the keyboard to work at all. Now they tell me since I'm no longer under warranty they won't do anything about this. Horrible customer appreciation for a product that costs $80+...do yourself a favor and read all the reviews. You will undoubtedly end up with the same issues.

  Can I give this a zero star. This is how Logitech customer services respond to a compliant. Ticket no.2911917 raised on the 30th April 2020 I have only had it 2 months and the rubber is peeling off.  All my equipment is Logitech and this has never happened to me before. You pay good money and expect good quality. Lets see what Logitech have to say. Logi_Matt4 hours ago Hi Steve Barnes, Thank you for reaching Logitech! We apologize for not providing a prompt response. It's sad that the mouse is turning out this way on your end. Wear and tear are bound to happen but it should definitely not be getting this issue in just mere 2 months. We recommend you to submit a ticket to our support team for help about the matter. If you have further inquiry, please do not hesitate to reach back to us or contact our support team for direct assistance. Regards, Logi_Matt  Sanjay V (Logi) May 6, 9:00 AM PDT Thank you for your response I sincerely apologize for the delay in getting back to you and apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. May I ask you if you have tried contacting the point of purchase? Once again, thank you for taking the time to write to us. Feel free to reply to this email and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for choosing Logitech, have a great day! Please feel free to respond to this email. Thank you, Logitech Support Hi Sanjay Have you actually read the correspondence as it it obvious you have not. Can you please Pass this onto your manager and confirm you have done this please. Can you also please provide me with your complaints department email and a name. When you purchase an item from a so called well renowned company you expect a positive response. Not a negative one.   I have only had the item 3 months and it is falling apart.  Its under your warrantee and you need to honour it. Kind regards Steve Sent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.

  Great Marketing Terrible Products Awful Customer Service Non-Existent Technical Support ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have purchased a total of 3 mouses from Logitech. Yes, 3 mouses! I have spent 300 euros in total. I bought the MX Master 2 for myself and was very happy. So I bought a second 1 for my father as well. After a while, my MX Maters 2 started to act out to a point where it very negatively impacted my work. I tried everything I could. Reinstalling their software multiple times, reinstalling my Mac software, etc. After a while, I got so frustrated with the mouse that I just threw it in the garbage and bought a new one, the MX Master 3. I just received it a couple weeks ago, connected it to my iMac and started working. After about 2 hours of work, the mouse has decided not to work out of nowhere. I have reinstalled the software, restarted my computer and it simply wasn't working. I have contacted their support over the phone, they barely spoke English and then transferred me to a number that wasn't working. Then, I decided to create a ticket through their website. I waited a week just to be told that I should go on their website and look for their FAQ section to resolve my issue. Are you kidding? 1 week to tell me that? I also tried contacting them over Facebook live chat and was told to submit a ticket. It's been over two weeks since I bought my third mouse and it's still not working. No one at Logitech seems to care to help their clients.  Logitech: If I wanted a cheap mouse, I would spend 5 euros on Amazon.

  Worst customer service ever..... Purchased a keyboard from Logitech.com. 48 hours later there was no confirmation email or acknowledgement of the order yet they'd certainly taken my money! I used their 'findmyorder' system to check for an order associated with my email address but 'No Order Found' was returned to me. Decided to submit an enquiry through the logitech website, received a confirmation email from a random company called Digital River which made no reference to Logitech at all yet the timing seemed coincidental so assumed it must have been them. 48 hours later, still no response. Followed up by replying to the Digital River email only to be told they cannot help me as they are simply a reseller??? Why are you the point of contact for customer service then? I then found another way of contacting Logitech only to be sent to an outsourced offshore support team. They take 3 business days to reply to any message and must not actually read any of my messages so no progress is ever made. After a few days of all this I ordered my keyboard from a different company and received it within 24 hours. I told Logitech not to bother sending the keyboard as i'd purchased elsewhere and they finally agreed to cancel the order. The funds were returned from my card... happy days. or so I thought! Then 2 days later I receive a tracking number for a delivery from Logitech! I check my bank balance and they had re-debited the order! What the? That was over a week ago... now I have two keyboards and no matter what I do am unable to organise a return with Logitech as the support staff continually ignore the request. The returns form on their website also does not work as it says my order number is not found! Literally at a loss of where to turn now... massively disappointed with a company that makes such great products. Sort yourselves out otherwise no quality product will save you.

  MK550 keyboard and Mouse Combo 1) I am on my second K350 Wireless keyboard from this combo and it will be the last. Main problems is the printing on the keys wears off and there is NO replacement, from Logitech. After market stickers do not last very well. These characters should be permanent. In this day of cast/moulded characters, this is simple unacceptable. 2) Absolutely hideous SetPoint software. Supposed to show BUNDLED M510 mouse tab but not there. Unifying Software can see it clearly.. Prog tells me to install Options.. which i do and it does absolutely SFA. Try reinstalling etc in the usual way but still stubbornly refuses to do anything. Logitech have had years to get their act together and no doubt countless people complain AFTER buying their rubbish, so why would they bother? This is both absurd and unacceptable. What is wrong with these people? Their dominance of the market has made them lazy and disrespectful of their customers. 1 star because 0 is not possible.

  Well I can only say their customer service is very poor, they don't reply back to your emails, no landline no nothing. I have an issue with my powerplay, is not charging anymore so I contacted via website support. Someone replied back to me saying to give them serial number, done and dusted. After few days the same person is asking me to destroy my powerplay so I can get a replacement as the old one is not working anymore. Ok, destroyed my powerplay and uploaded the video on youtube as their request and is been accepted as a proof. After 2 weeks the same person is telling me customer service department will email me with tracking number soon, they actually done it after 5 days so in total almost 1 month. All good and nicely, they finally email me, the actual parcel is coming and I was straight away shocked with the size of the parcel (remember when I bought my powerplay it was a massive box) but guess what, this one was a tiny little box. Opened the box, received a cable instead by mistake. Took some pictures with what I received and emailed back logi support. Again, the same person is replying back (that was last week) saying they will have to review it internally and get back to me. Since last week no one replied back to me. So now basically I have a powerplay unit in pieces which can't be used anymore, their department is not even bothered replying to your problems but yes they want money for theirs expensive products!!!

  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!! Really shockingly bad customer service, no telephone numbers (that get answered), no online chat with a person just a bloody useless chatbot. Order not found on website yet Digital River have taken my money. Various messages sent via the website and social media all with no response. I know logistics are difficult at the moment but come on, none of the other companies that I have dealt with over the last month have been this bad. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.

  I purchased a headset that broke after 2 months. I have been dealing with their customer support and after 2 weeks responding to me they now say I have to be switched to the gaming dept which they will not respond. This is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I have never did a review with anyone that was negative but think twice before you buy a Logitech item cause they do not warrant their products.

  Don't bother ordering. They don't seem to have stuff in stock despite saying that they do; they don't despatch when the say they will; they take your money as soon as you order not when shipped even tho their website says they don't; they currently have no phone customer care; their online customer support is totally unacceptable as they don't read your emails but merely reply with information that it already on their website; they ignore your request to cancel an order. Woeful doesn't come close. Truly dreadful

  Placed and order on the 27th April for the silver MX Master mouse. Within 30mins I change my mind and tried to change the order to the black version.  Firstly, there was no option to amend the order. Then I tried to contact the customer service online and by email. I got no response. I then called the number provided. The first two calls I spoke to Vincent, who quickly muted my call and left me waiting for over 5mins each time.  I then while on hold I rang with a different phone. Spoke with a woman this time. The connection was suspiciously ""faulty"" and kept cutting in and out. I eventually, communicated that I would like to change the colour of the order or cancel it. The woman confirmed they would cancel the order and told me to look out for the cancellation email. I received an email from Vincent stating they would cancel the order if I replied with the details. I did this straight away. I never got a confirmation email despite requesting one several times.  Today 30th April, I have got a confirmation of shipment email, despite all of my attempts to cancel the order.  I am very annoyed as it says in their terms and conditions that the customer is responsible for paying for Returns shipping cost.

  Never posted a review like this before. I bought a €250 webcam which was advertised on the logitech site as in stock. It wasn't so I bought elsewhere - but Logitech would not allow me to cancel the item, even though it had not shipped. Then once delivered their customer service would not issue any instructions on how to return the unopened product. I have been trying for 2 weeks to get a response. I have never experienced anything like this.

  This is probably the worst customer support I've had to deal with, EVER. First of all they don't pick up. I was on hold for roughly 45 minutes before getting to anyone. Then the lady put me on hold to figure out how to help and the call got disconnected on their side. Of course when I called back had to wait again which I didn't have time for. So the next day I'm still trying to reach someone. As soon as they answer the phone and say hi, the phone goes silent and I can't hear anything. I think this is just a tactic not to speak to their customers. This is just not fair!!!

  Ordered a webcam, paid for express delivery and heard nothing for 2 weeks. Was pragmatic to think it might be CV19 related however when looking to try and find out information about the order status there is a lack of info and no customer service line to speak to someone about this. All the time they have taken my money when actually most companies take on dispatch. Tried to get the facebook messenger team to help but they were absolutely useless and kept referring me to product support. Useless! one of the worst customer journeys I have had!!!!
    "
Logitech,Technology,1 star: Bad," 
  I appreciate that Covid is causing issues, but if you have a website that says a webcam is in stock, accept my order and take my payment it seems reasonable to assume that I have made a valid purchase and can expect delivery. But after 2.5 weeks nothing - no webcam, no update on my account, no response from customer services, no email communication to me..... And I used to think that Logitech was a reputable business.

  MOUSE SHAPE in the WIRELESS COMBO—WINDOWS-CHROME The new Logitech mouse shares a hand design that is a proven Fail against others like GearHead. Its about the shape or grasp. This hourglass shape has the narrow place located in the middle of the mouse instead of where normal sized hands want to grasp—up near the nose of the mouse where the fingertip controls are located. I have a great pic to describe at a glance what is going on but I see not photo upload tool. New keyboard is perfect for a basic, which is what I wanted the most. Even includes minimal value added functions at the top that doesn't take up too much real estate which always robs from qwerty button structure. I can use or ignore them but find them useful, so thx for that Logi.  Wish I could use the mouse that came with. Wasted resources.

  Firstly it's worth mentioning that I didn't experience the delivery delay that others have had - the items were shipped 3 days after the order was placed. However, I initially made an order for a Logitech Stream Cam but very quickly changed my mind to spend a little more on a BRIO Stream - I called up Logitech support roughly 15 minutes after placing the Stream Cam order and explained that I would like to cancel the Stream Cam order - The woman on the phone said this should be fine, you can cancel any order up until it's been shipped. I checked a few times and order number no longer showed as existing, which led me to believe this had been cancelled - I've just received an e-mail saying ""unfortunately you didn't cancel this order in time, so we will still be charging you for the product"" - In what world is 15 minutes after placing an order ""not in time"" to cancel it? Logitech clearly states that you can cancel any orders up until they have been shipped. To put the cherry on top, I am unable to launch a refund/returns issue because the order number *still* doesn't show as existing - Meaning I will have to try my best to get in touch with them again and find out a solution.  I would strong recommend using an alternative company in the future - There is no reason in 2020 for a company to not have a simplified cancellation procedure or an easy contact route for returns/issues with order numbers.  Avoid Logitech.

  I used to use logitech exclusively. Everyone Knew their switches were a lottery, but they would replace their faulty device until you got a good one. Apparently they don't do that anymore. I've bought 3 of their mice in the past year, because I used to like supporting their company. I developed a double click on one, no problem I thought, I'll use another. It too got a double click a month later. So I emailed logitech, expecting their usual customer service... but then they asked me to try about 3 hours worth of troubleshooting. When that didn't work, they wanted me to take a video of me proving it didn't work. I'm done buying from this company. How you go from the best customer service immediately to the worst, is beyond me.

  Worst customer service ever... Headset broke... still in warranty so i emailed them. Took over a week for a reply and they asked for photo and proof of purchase. Supplied these. Expecting a new headset to be posted asap. Week later they request a video of the broken head????? A video what?? And when i tried to upload it it was rejected due to their mail policy. Worst company ever. Dont bother buying their stuff.

  My story is the same as many others ordered an item that was showing in stock only to never arrive. I ordered a webcam on March 25th but it had still not arrived on April 6th I paid extra for express postage. The money was taken from my account the day after ordering by Digital River a company Logitech use to process the payment they have worst reviews than Logitech on Trust Pilot. It was lucky I used Paypal and opened a dispute for non-delivery and received a full refund yesterday. The customer service is diabolical the only contact I had from them was to tell me two weeks after I had ordered that your order will be another 3 weeks. If they had told me that I would have to wait 5 weeks for delivery would I have placed an order NO.

  Probably the worst customer experience I've ever had to deal with. They ask you to take pictures and answer tons of questions (because of course you are a liar and a bad customer for them), then if you're motivated enough to reach that stage, they just basically tell you that they can't do anything for you. This was litterally my experience with them.

  I purchased a web came to work from home on the 4th April 20. Received an e-mail with status in process. Sent an e-mail to Logitech support requesting an ETA and after 10 days received a response that they are unable to give me an ETA. They are happy to take the money however not willing to give us an ETA. The worst service ever. If had a choice I would give them no stars.

  I ordered a webcam to make some telework at home, 15 days have passed from the order date, since then I have not received any information from them and my order still in ""process"". There is no way to communicate with them, they are not answering any call made by phone and you do not have any email to contact them. If you look on Facebook there are many people writing about the same issue. I believed that they are selling stuff that they do not have in stock. They are very disrespectful. at least if you could get your money back and buy from another store...

  I was bought a wireless silent clicker mouse and can honestly say it's brilliant. The M590 model connects via bluetooth to a small device you plug into the usb port. It works at a good distance and fits nicely in hand. The silent clicking feature is great to avoid the annoyance of others.

  I have owned Logitech products since the early 90’s and every single one I’ve had has been a pleasure to own. I can’t recall ever having any issues with a Logitech product so I have never had to deal with their customer service or warranty and cannot speak for the quality of either. I have owned computer speakers, webcams, wired headsets, chargers and charging stations for iOS products, keyboards, mice, combinations of both keyboard and mice, and their Harmony remotes. I don’t know what else to say about them other than I believe the quality of the products they make are really good and durable, not cheaply made or flimsy. I am definitely “brand loyal” to anything Logitech.  The most recent item I purchased from them is the MX Master 3 mouse. The reason I went with this mouse was for two primary reasons. The first being the ability to use this mouse via Bluetooth between multiple computers even when the computers don’t share the same OS. That is working out very well for me and efficiently too. The second reason was for the ergonomics of the mouse itself and I have found this one to be very comfortable on the hand and the wrist. Some other things to note about the MX Master 3 is the battery life of the mouse is fantastic! I don’t have a hard number off the top of my head, but it lasts a few good months before needing a charge which is done by a USB-C cable included with the mouse. Also, the buttons. There are a perfect amount of buttons which you can program to take care of different functions. Some that you probably didn’t even know was possible, which I actually discovered after purchasing the mouse. I didn’t realize it has an app that could be used to program them for different uses.

  I would never have thought that a company as well know as Logitech would be so dishonest and provide such bad customer service. I understand that these are unusual times but they should at least make an effort to provide accurate and honest answers to customer inquiries. My experience is similar to what others are recounting so I'll keep it short... When I placed my order on the Logitech website the item (webcam) showed in stock. They took my money and after a week I requested an update and I was told that it was pending but there was no ETA I then pointed out that according to their website I should not have been charged until my item shipped and said they could not refund my money because I used PayPal. I my experience that is not true. I asked them to cancel my order because my order has clearly not shipped and as you might guess they said that since the order was sent to the warehouse it could not be cancelled. Needles to say that when I eventually get my product I am going to return it unopened and I will never buy another Logitech product again.

  Would give zero stars if I could.  Ordered a Brio Ultra HD Pro Webcam on 28th March that said it was in stock and paid extra for 2 day delivery as I desperately needed it for work (I cancelled an order elsewhere that had one on backorder). Contacted Logitech a few days later as I had no despatch note, and was then informed by the team they had a 7-10 day backlog in picking (thanks for not telling me earlier), but not to worry because the product was definitely in stock. Oh by the way, the extra payment for delivery was apparently only the delivery timescale once it was picked, not from order to delivery! Waited patiently for 8 days for my despatch note email and then received an email from Logitech (great!) saying that I would NOT get the item until June as there was a backlog (WTH?!) - what happened to my product that was definitely in stock and just being picked!  Checked my bank statement and they had taken payment when ordered so I contacted their team to cancel the order and they said it would take 7 - 10 days to process a refund and there is nothing they could do, no discussion, that was their process (well my process is that if you take my money immediately you return it immediately, funnily enough they work to whatever they want to). So there you go, appalling £215 out of pocket until they refund, 20 days after taking my money (still waiting). Avoid ordering direct at all cost, I hope this review helps at least one other person avoid this situation. I wish I had done a search on reviews first, but you expect a company like Logitech with decent products to offer an equally decent buying service - this is sadly not the case.

  I ordered on 1st of April one Brio Stream web camera and one MX Master 3 mice. When I ordered both, they were available according to the online store. The update from Logitech was that both shipped and they would be delivered. When I checked with UPS, I worried as the package seamed too small. Finally, on the 6th of April, the package arrived, but it contained only the mice.  The call centre is not available, and I managed to open a ticket where I had not received any update from them. Luckily enough, I purchased the items using PayPal, so I filled a claim through PayPal for a refund.  If you check in their forums, there are more than 2.000 complaints with shipment issues.  Verdict: Logitech owns me 220 GBP not calculating my time that I need to spend for making a claim back, any interest that I am loosing and that I am not able to do my work.  Although they have friendly products avoid at any cost ordering from their online shop and good luck if you find anything available in the online retailers. Update on 14.04.2020 I filled a claim with PayPal as Logitech is unable to provide any kind of support. What they are proposing is for me to wait for them to ship the product (they don't know when), deny the package and when the package reaches back their warehouse they can issue a refund.  Update on 21.04.2020 They didn't manage to cancel the shipping on time, and they stick to their process, which means that I need to wait for an extra two to three weeks for the camera to be returned to their central hub in Holland from the UK and then proceed with the refund. In the meantime, they are not responding to PayPal on my dispute claim.  Update 26.04.2020 PayPal closed the dispute on my favour. Logitech didn't bother to reply to PayPal at all.  Conclusion As Logitech has friendly products and at the same time retailers don't have availability, as Logitech has better margins to sell direct, buy from Logitech but only if you are using PayPal and you are ready to get delayed. Another advice from my side, buy one product per order if it is possible.

  I had though that i had a good headset (logitech G933). Until i realized that i wasn't using the Logitech software that is recommended along with it. FOR TWO YEARS, without this software, i had the perfect headset. Until i got Logitech G hub. Immediately after getting the software my headset started bugging out and muting my Mic. Furthermore, now as of the newest update my ability to regulate volume has started to bug out as well! I would attempt to turn down my volume, but whats this? I moved it a milometer down but it has decided to ________ BLAST MY VOLUME TO MAX? thank G HUB! You may think, hey... it worked fine before right? why not get rig of G hub! GREAT IDEA! So i DID!~ Guess what, NO CHANGES WHAT SO EVER. I have even reinstalled my computer... ALL OF THESE BUGS STILL PERSIST and i haven't even installed G HUB ON MY NEW FRESH BLANK WINDOWS... ____ YOU, THANKS FOR RUINING MY HEADSET! (oh did i also mention that G HUB cant see my LOGITECH GAMING KEYBOARD [G105]?) I am so infuriated, i enjoy when the product i purchase last their intended lifetimes.

  I own the following hardwear. G915 keyboard,powerplay mat,the g903 and 502 mice,G560 speakers and G933 headpjones. They are great bits of kit. Good quality reliable and i would recommened themto anyone.But........Ghub!!! What an absolute piece of crap. Whoever, designed this softwear needs firing and never work on softwear again. It is litterally the worst piece of softwear ive ever used. All the peripherals show up with no problem.I can sync the lighting so they all match, which is fine. But the point of having all these light effects is so you can sync games profiles, so eveything works together and without pulling your hair out trying to get it to do basic tasks, like find the games running on the computer. I thought i was possibly doing something worng or missing something. However, a quick search on the web just confirms i'm not alone. It seems everyone is having similar issues and the complaints are the same. The previous softwear worked well, not perfect, but at least it found my games and automatically set up the lighting profiles. It wasn't a nice looking as Ghub but, honestly, whos cares what it looks like as long as it works!! The quick solution would be to bring back the older softwear, which no longer works and if you try and download it directs you to Ghub. Logitech have been around for years, but this softwear makes them looks like a newbie, with little understanding of what the user wants. Something that just works!

  Create an online order where it says 2 days delivery and it just sits there for a week with a status of 'In Process'.

  I wanted to order a webcam so I can hold video conferences from home - understandably many companies are out of stock. So I ordered one directly from Logitech and paid extra (£15) for 2-3 day delivery. Needless to say after 3 days: no webcam, no tracking number, no information on website and no way of contacting customer services. If they're out of stock or experiencing delays because of Covid-19 they should say this upfront (like other companies) when you're placing the order. So I've sent an email cancelling my order - if no refund in a week's time I'll be contacting my credit card company. Update: after one week received a reply from the email address given in their T&amp;Cs (in the cancellation section) to say they don't deal with cancellations - so apparently no way of cancelling the order.

  Honestly, I like their products, however they just suck at providing customer service. There is almost no way to contact them about a specific thing you need answers for. Looked all over their website and there is a few ways to contact them. However, the contact info provide is only for certain products. Their website has no way to contact them about general issues (orders,products,etc). I ordered a headset with the ""fast"" shipping option and its not even on its way. I just want to know what is going with my order.

  Bought a 100€ mouse that promised Logitech Flow and configurable buttons. I work both on Windows and macOS so it was a no-brainer. I got two Macs, the mouse works with Flow on the older one (Mojave) and my Windows computer but not on the one with macOS Catalina 10.15.3. I contacted the support, reiterated 10 times that there is a software issue with Logitech Options, what I got back were the permission articles which I've seen a hundred times and set everything up correctly and then they were like: replace your mouse on warranty. There is no hardware problem the mouse works fine with the older Mac but I didn't splash 2400 on a new computer just to keep on using the old one. With how Logitech Options behaves on macOS Catalina 10.15.3, I cannot use Logitech Flow, cannot even map my buttons the way I want them because they get reset each time. As long as your product works, all is good. When it only stops working they way it should the support guys are unbelievably clueless. Is it really that hard to let the dev team ""we got a bug""? I am a dev myself, indicated that I'll be happy to provide them with logs, plists and whatever they need to fix it. Nah, just replace your mouse, for sure it'll work. -_-

  PRO: •Nice products, intuitive, awesome features especially the MX master series, comfortable. NICE TO HAVE: • I know that we have to make sacrifices to get a long time battery, but I would like to be the one who chooses this. Eg: MX master 3 is ok for work and I don't feel a big need for responsiveness but I play games casually and the problem is not that it's not fast but the movement in an FPS is very choppy. CON: •Hard to talk with them, I have a problem with the software from MX master 3 mouse, it doesn't let me customize to see the Task View from the gesture button customization. •Bad materials, DUUDE wth... seriously I've used the first MX Master 1 and the left button started to become glossy, the same thing with the MX Master 2S but I was expecting more from MX Master 3. But no... it's worst. On the old mouse, this problem started to happen in a few months while on MX Master 3 the problem showed up in 1 week, there's a big shiny spot on the left button. The device is clean, I clean my peripherals almost daily. I would be ok to pay a bit more just to get better materials.

  Logitech MX Master 3 starts making weird doubling clicking sounds on left click and the mouse wheel seems to be loose. All of that happened within a month with minimal use. The customer support offered my first some tips on how to check my bluetooth connection and if everything is plugged in (wow!). After that, someone replied again asking me to make a video of the problem, like what the hell? Why can't I just send it back for investigation/RMA? Seems to be to hard for this company. Will not buy from Logitech again, on many ends the MX Master 3 is cheap as hell. Low polling rate and breaking, crackling components after a month, WOW.

  I own a Mac, and logitech software refuses to work with Mojave, 10.14.6 Mac OS. It was having trouble with 10.13 and 10.12 as well, but I could usually get it to work, sort of. But now with 10.14 it does NOTHING, just right and left buttons of 13 buttons. and I DO have the latest update. I expect them to go out of business anytime. No tech support, ignored, and with all these one star reviews, they clearly have completely lost it.

  i am a hardcore gamer and i have all consoles and all systems , i pay around 1k in gaming each year , i ve been using logitech for a while without probs. two months ago i purchased an g903 gaming mouse from amazon in an offer which started to produce double click errors , a common problem as i searched the net. Mouse was purchased on amazon europe site and send to my country of residence, i ve contacted amazon and they can refund me if i send it back but this was bought in a promotion and therefore price now is significant more , i contacted logitech support requesting rma , after providing proof of purchase etc they send me this stupid msg Thank you for the response, I would like to inform you we do not support International warranties. In order to get warranty coverage, your product must be exchanged from the country of purchase. We suggest that you contact the place of purchase to see if they have an International warranty option. If we can help in any other way, please let us know. You can find our warranty terms and conditions here Thank you for choosing Logitech G. For sure i wont do the same mistake again to choose logitech ,under european legislation they are forced to provide warranty in european union , i asked to escalate this to a supervisor but i dont see that they will oblige . In the end i will return this back but i wont buy logitech again....

  Product has broken 14 months into its life. Logitech don’t want to know and can’t even advise anything as product discontinued. It is an Apple Ipad Pro II Create Backlit Cover. Clearly had I known it was going to be discontinued then I wouldn’t have spent over £130 on it a little over a year ago. Problem is the cheap plastic around the side of the cover breaks off (a common problem according to other reviewers) and therefore it doesn’t hold the Ipad in place. I wouldn’t buy any Logitech products again after this experience and would advise others against doing so.

I ordered an item last week, received an order confirmation but then the charge was removed from my credit card.......they had apparently cancelled my order without telling me. When I tried to order again, the item was listed as out of stock. I submitted an inquiry to customer service but no response except they sent my inquiry back to me and nothing else. What the?????

  Just opened a G600 purchased last year, left-click stuck, slow bounce back, which make double clicking sometimes not perform. Contact the support with the issue. Keep asking me to provide a photo to reproduce the issue. A photo? How? That's a waste of my time, so I tossed the mouse away, not happy with their service provided.

  Ordered on the 2/15. Site said arrival 4-7 business days. In touch with customer support they said "" it should be in stock on the 20th"". When I placed the order there was no notification of "" out of stock"". Website has shown in stock ( except for one day i checked that said out of stock) and no emails or notification from them. They took my money out of my account fast, but still no shipping as of 2/25 ( 10 days later).  I had to laugh when they sent me a email advertising Free expedited shipping on items. I tested and it ""could"" be applied to the same item I bought and am still waiting for. Who are they kidding? I would be weary of ordering and go retail if you HAVE to have a Logitech item. But I would be concerned if they will actually fulfill any warranty requests. I wonder if they have new management, because in the past I never had such issues with them.

  Very poor Customer Service - Emails were back and forth with no real resolution. Their representative is not sure of they're refund requirements and so he asked me to destroy the product and give them the photos - which I did. The next email said that, the refund can't be processed because they needed a ""VAT invoice"". Given the circumstances, I may not be able to provide it as I purchased it in a third party company. Point is, they asked me to destroy it first before confirming with me the requirements for the refund. Now I don't have the refund - and my faulty C920 Camera is now fully destroyed by me. Funny. Also, their email representatives' emails are redundant and they seem to not read through the emails carefully and just responds meaninglessly. The email thread went for 1 month and about 43 emails sent and received. I'll never purchase again from Logitech as the customer service and possibly the products are very unsatisfactory.

I was going to switch from Razer to Logitech because of synapse 3 but i guess i wont. Logitech is real nightmare. Never gonna buy ""premium"" trash. Im happy that EU laws protect customers so i can return without any reason (14 days period).  Logitech was good back in days with Logitech gaming software but now its just waste of your free time. I lose entire day on fixing something that is on their end.  G935 250 euros G815 280 euros G903 150 euros Powerplay 115 euros 795 euros scam. This was the biggest scam ive ever had in my life.

  Hey everyone...well, I’m not big in writing positive reviews but I’m a plumber so customer reviews are always a huge plus...when people actually write a review when they’re satisfied. So I will get to the point, I bought this Universal Folio a couple weeks ago and could not activate it to my iPad 6 and went first with Apple, but Apple will not help since, “its not an apple product”, and so I dreaded the moment of having to call this manufacturer since 1) I had never heard of them and 2) it was cheap. Red flag: possibly people with sucky customer support. I was proven wrong. Called and did not stay on hold for long. And on top of that, once the rep and I spoke, he was right to the point and got my Folio activated without any hassles. AND he emailed me a bigger troubleshooting manual for future issues. (But this was my only issue so I’m not worried about others). So idk if it was beginners luck or if others are too picky but I’m a happy customer. Great product and cool rep I spoke with. I will recommend this product to others and I’ll sure be looking further deep into other products to purchase!

  TL;DR Customer support fails, does not give you your money back even if it's your right. Do not purchase a product from Logitech if you want this mess to happen to you too. Every other review here says it: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!  I used to own a G933 (headset). Due to a faulty design choice the switch comes loose after a few months and each time I contacted the support and received a replacement device. I did this twice, (3 headsets in total) but after the fourth time in almost 2 years I've had enough and asked for a refund (As a European citizen I have this right).... Boy oh boy I've been waiting for 4 months now.. - 31st of October 2019, I sent a message with all the details and the fact it's the fourth time now. They promised me in November 2019 that I'd get my money back within a short period of time, asking me for some contact information. I gave them all the info, but then politely asked me to let my legal guardian to create a new ticket (mentioning the old ticket) for the refund to progress as I'm only 17 and thus not of legal age. They immediately updated the status to ""solved"" without any message, and this is where everything went south. I then decided to contact the customer service through phone, after giving them my information once again they said they'd pass it through the refund process and that I'd receive a mail in 3-5 business days. This was on the 19th of December. On the 8th of January I then once again asked them about the status, and they told me ""we have sent another follow up to check the status for the refund."" Today, the 14th of January, I have sent yet another mail to ask for the status, stating that I've been waiting for 4 months now and that it would've taken ""up to 3-5 business days"" according to them. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get my money back?

  Logitech oversee the Ultimate Ears speaker brand. I first raised a major problem with my two UE 'MegaBlast' speakers (circa £400 spent in total) back in April 2019, not long after I'd bought them. It's now January 2020 and they've done nothing but stall and get me to unnecessarily jump through hoops. There's no mechanism to speak to anyone beyond the standard off-shore call centre operators.

  Over the years I've bought around 20 Logitech mice. I stick with Logitech because they have proper customisation software for all the mouse buttons, and I use all the buttons for my specific task-oriented purposes. However recently, all the customisations become inactive, after a PC running Windows 10 wakes from a 'sleep'. Thus all my investment in Logitech mice is now trashed, and I have to work around this limitation by using gesture control (which is performed by PC software and operates independently of the Logitech software and hardware). I have been communicating with Logitech over the past 3 months, and given them every single dump and bit of date they've asked for, and now they are basically ignoring me.  How hard can it be to fix a reproducible problem like this? How hard up can Logitech be that they can't buy or borrow a Microsoft Surface Pro to test out their devices? This is a disgrace.

Another fun fact is that after a year the spacebar switch on 910 broke. I bought 2, not 1, 2!! g35 and both broke in the same spot: a pivot near earcup, same for a friend of mine who also had one of the worst experiences with customer service cause of this; same story for the first release of g502,I had to ask for replace first moths cause left click used to register more clicks, and again g903 sensor went burnt, now I have a cool piece of rgb furniture on my desk that reminds me everytime: ""don't buy this waay overpriced piece of bat guano with a big g on it"". -Proud owner of a ducky one keyboard that still doesn't show a problem after 2 years of use.

Now after six months the new dongle usb contacts had delaminated from the board and i have a broken mouse dongle and an orphan keyboard. What a poor product quality and support.

  Really poor experience of Logitech customer service. I foolishly thought that being such a big company I would not need to check site reviews on trustpilot.... How wrong was I. It took them.one month to provide me with return authorisation details. This was only after they had closed no less than 3 support tickets without my consent. When I finally did get the return authorisation the item needed to be returned to California depsite being purchased in the UK Logitech store. Customer service were unsure of how to best complete the customs paperwork. Fortunately I managed to sell the item rather than return it as I had very little faith my refund would be handled well once they received the item.  A total shambles. Avoid at all costs, I dread to think what their warranty support is like.

  The woman ended up transferring me 2 times. Once I got there, she was telling me what to do but wasn't making sure I was following along. I got lost multiple times and she didn't bother to help with such. I then got called ""sir"" 5 times when I clearly sound female and told them my female name. The call lasted 46 minutes and I asked to be passed to someone else maybe and she refused that idea multiple times. At the 40 minute mark she said the call has lasted too long for her to handle and that I would have to call back another day to someone else because we were taking too long. I feel as you shouldn't tell customers to call a different day because you dont want to deal with their long issue tech problems. Anyways, at the end of this 46 minute call, we resolved nothing and my problem still remains. I ended up just calling a friend after this happened and we solved my issue in less than 20 minutes. Their customer service sucks.

  Worse customer service experience I have ever had. I bought a Logitech G Pro Keyboard. Withing a few months they the Ctrl keycap came off. The pegs that latch into sockets on the actual board broke off inside the sockets. There was really no way for me to fix it. Because the Roamer G switches are proprietary, I can’t just buy a new keycap and replace it and because the pegs broke inside the socket I couldn’t replace the keycap even if I had that option. I contacted Logitech support to request that they fix the keyboard because it was under warranty.  This is where things started to go downhill. At first they requested that I send them a proof of purchase and pictures of the damage. After I did this they alleged that they were unable to view the pictures I sent them. They then requested that I make a video of the damage. I also did this and they also said they were unable to view the video that I sent to them.  At this point I was very frustrated. Later on the Logitech representative admits that they had actually in fact seen the photos but that they needed a video in order to process the warranty. I told them I had sent the video multiple times over email. They then requested me to provide them with a Google Drive link for them to download it or to upload them to youtube. I told them that I would do no such thing. That I have a right to keep my accounts with other companies private and that they should provide their customers with a way for us to send them the videos directly if that is part of their warranty process.  They refused to process the warranty. At this point I questioned them as to why I couldn’t just ship the keyboard directly to them to inspect and repair the damage. They refused and then asked me to actually send them a video of me destroying the keyboard so they can send me a new one. Of course I completely refused. The request is just outrageous. Especially given the fact that I had already sent them video over email and claimed they didn’t get it and now they are asking me to make a video of me destroying the keyboard? Finally they “closed” they ticket and refused to honor the warranty!

  What a dysfunctional, useless support service. Had a warranty claim for a £47 headset (nine months in), so tried registering on their website - and got 'page not found' errors. (One of the two main support links on their website goes to 'page not found', which tells you how much they care about follow-up support!) Rang their call centre (which required me to call an overseas number from the UK!), and after spending 15mins taking my details over a very poor-quality line, the agent told me she couldn't help me - each product has a different team, and I'd have to wait up to 2 days for that specific team to call me back! Fortunately, I'd actually bought the product through Amazon, so I contacted them, and they were brilliant - they've already despatched a replacement headset, and given me a pre-paid label to send back the old one. Lesson: don't ever buy anything directly off Logitech, their follow-up support is terrible - buy it off Amazon or a retail store instead, and use them for follow-up support.

  Logitech oversee the Ultimate Ears speaker brand. I first raised a major problem with my two UE 'MegaBlast' speakers (circa £400 spent in total) back in April 2019, not long after I'd bought them. It's now January 2020 and they've done nothing but stall and get me to unnecessarily jump through hoops. There's no mechanism to speak to anyone beyond the standard off-shore call centre operators.  Logitech have waste my time, taken my money and sent me mad.

  Over the years I've bought around 20 Logitech mice. I stick with Logitech because they have proper customisation software for all the mouse buttons, and I use all the buttons for my specific task-oriented purposes. However recently, all the customisations become inactive, after a PC running Windows 10 wakes from a 'sleep'. Thus all my investment in Logitech mice is now trashed, and I have to work around this limitation by using gesture control (which is performed by PC software and operates independently of the Logitech software and hardware). I have been communicating with Logitech over the past 3 months, and given them every single dump and bit of date they've asked for, and now they are basically ignoring me.  How hard can it be to fix a reproducible problem like this? How hard up can Logitech be that they can't buy or borrow a Microsoft Surface Pro to test out their devices? This is a disgrace.

  I had a g510 back in 2014-15, sold for a g910, few weeks later the buyer contacted me he wanted his money back cause g keys stopped working all at a sudden; fun fact I never used these keys, I just bought that keyboard for stilish metallic blue-grey paint .-.. Another fun fact is that after a year the spacebar switch on 910 broke. I bought 2, not 1, 2!! g35 and both broke in the same spot: a pivot near earcup, same for a friend of mine who also had one of the worst experiences with customer service cause of this; same story for the first release of g502,I had to ask for replace first moths cause left click used to register more clicks, and again g903 sensor went burnt, now I have a cool piece of rgb furniture on my desk that reminds me everytime: ""don't buy this waay overpriced piece of bat guano with a big g on it"". -Proud owner of a ducky one keyboard that still doesn't show a problem after 2 years of use.

  i used to own a bundle of of logitech keyboard k360 and m185 mouse which they came together, after a year the mouse stopped working and after research i bought the same type of mouse to pair with my keyboard in one dongle. its seems the mouse i bought (m185) communicates with different protocol and how much i searched it cannon communicate together with the previous dongle. nor the new dongle works with the keyboard. it seems the latter is nano receiver and the new is unyfying or vice versa. Now after six months the new dongle usb contacts had delaminated from the board and i have a broken mouse dongle and an orphan keyboard. What a poor product quality and support. Well i stopped and i will spread to people to stop buying from this company as it doesnt honor their products and frustrate the customers as i can read from reviews. Enjoy the fall ""poortech""

  Really poor experience of Logitech customer service. I foolishly thought that being such a big company I would not need to check site reviews on trustpilot.... How wrong was I. It took them.one month to provide me with return authorisation details. This was only after they had closed no less than 3 support tickets without my consent. When I finally did get the return authorisation the item needed to be returned to California depsite being purchased in the UK Logitech store. Customer service were unsure of how to best complete the customs paperwork. Fortunately I managed to sell the item rather than return it as I had very little faith my refund would be handled well once they received the item.  A total shambles. Avoid at all costs, I dread to think what their warranty support is like.

  The woman ended up transferring me 2 times. Once I got there, she was telling me what to do but wasn't making sure I was following along. I got lost multiple times and she didn't bother to help with such. I then got called ""sir"" 5 times when I clearly sound female and told them my female name. The call lasted 46 minutes and I asked to be passed to someone else maybe and she refused that idea multiple times. At the 40 minute mark she said the call has lasted too long for her to handle and that I would have to call back another day to someone else because we were taking too long. I feel as you shouldn't tell customers to call a different day because you dont want to deal with their long issue tech problems. Anyways, at the end of this 46 minute call, we resolved nothing and my problem still remains. I ended up just calling a friend after this happened and we solved my issue in less than 20 minutes. Their customer service sucks.

  Worse customer service experience I have ever had. I bought a Logitech G Pro Keyboard. Withing a few months they the Ctrl keycap came off. The pegs that latch into sockets on the actual board broke off inside the sockets. There was really no way for me to fix it. Because the Roamer G switches are proprietary, I can’t just buy a new keycap and replace it and because the pegs broke inside the socket I couldn’t replace the keycap even if I had that option. I contacted Logitech support to request that they fix the keyboard because it was under warranty.  This is where things started to go downhill. At first they requested that I send them a proof of purchase and pictures of the damage. After I did this they alleged that they were unable to view the pictures I sent them. They then requested that I make a video of the damage. I also did this and they also said they were unable to view the video that I sent to them.  At this point I was very frustrated. Later on the Logitech representative admits that they had actually in fact seen the photos but that they needed a video in order to process the warranty. I told them I had sent the video multiple times over email. They then requested me to provide them with a Google Drive link for them to download it or to upload them to youtube. I told them that I would do no such thing. That I have a right to keep my accounts with other companies private and that they should provide their customers with a way for us to send them the videos directly if that is part of their warranty process.  They refused to process the warranty. At this point I questioned them as to why I couldn’t just ship the keyboard directly to them to inspect and repair the damage. They refused and then asked me to actually send them a video of me destroying the keyboard so they can send me a new one. Of course I completely refused. The request is just outrageous. Especially given the fact that I had already sent them video over email and claimed they didn’t get it and now they are asking me to make a video of me destroying the keyboard? Finally they “closed” they ticket and refused to honor the warranty!

  What a dysfunctional, useless support service. Had a warranty claim for a £47 headset (nine months in), so tried registering on their website - and got 'page not found' errors. (One of the two main support links on their website goes to 'page not found', which tells you how much they care about follow-up support!) Rang their call centre (which required me to call an overseas number from the UK!), and after spending 15mins taking my details over a very poor-quality line, the agent told me she couldn't help me - each product has a different team, and I'd have to wait up to 2 days for that specific team to call me back! Fortunately, I'd actually bought the product through Amazon, so I contacted them, and they were brilliant - they've already despatched a replacement headset, and given me a pre-paid label to send back the old one. Lesson: don't ever buy anything directly off Logitech, their follow-up support is terrible - buy it off Amazon or a retail store instead, and use them for follow-up support.

  I purchased a keyboard as pre-order. The website stated delivery in November, but did not specify a date. After 2 weeks of silence (but having paid for the product) I chased it online and a week later got a response (25th November: ""Upon checking on our system that your order is on process but we are waiting for the product will be available because as of the moment the product is not yet available, don't worry because once the product will be available we are going to prioritize your order""). Unhappy with the response, I phoned support (as 'customer service' is not available from this company). The support team placed a ticket to cancel my purchase (27th of November). I also requested her to send me an email confirming my cancellation. By the 6th of December I had not received any confirmation of cancellation of the order, no product and they still had my money. After a very long conversation on the phone, they sent me an email letting me know the manager would call back that same day. When he called back, I had already received an email cancelling my order, but the manager seemed to know little about this. None of their communications came with any apologies or estimated dates of delivery. The phone conversations lacked in useful information or professionalism.

  i bought a Logitech k750 last year. the keys fell out of keyboard. I know these things happen, so did not worry as I should be covered by a warranty. Well I thought I would be covered by a warranty , but Logitech refused to honor my warranty.  Logitech customer service sent me on a wild goose chase, which ended up in them asking me for my original receipt after two months. Really appalled by the refusal of Logitech to process a warranty for me because I did not have original receipt. Who nowadays keep their original receipts ( which Logitech know). I requested to best buy to give me receipt, but best buy only keep receipts on their system for 3 months ( which LOGITECH know) I did provide a bank statement that proves I made purchase but Logitech refuse to asknowledge this. . ill never buy from Logitech again, yes they have good products, but they are a cunning company. there have been plenty of occasions when I did not have original receipt, but manufacter still honoured the warrantly. My advise do not buy from Logitech if you think they will honor your warranty, they wont. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, NO DOUBT THEY WILL DELETE THIS POST, BUT THEY WONT DELETE MY POST ON OTHER REVIEW SITES IM GOING TO POST THIS ON.

  Logitech are CLUELESS. Loved the Harmony 700. Needed an update on ONE remote. They changed their software so ALL your devices and activities MUST go on one remote. I had two remotes: one for one room and another for another room with different set of devices and activities. Now it DROPPED devices and activities and won't let me sync one set of Harmony devices. AND I just bought two new ones on the internet that are NOW GARBAGE! I can only hope my older harmony software will still separate the two devices or I now own 5 useless devices!

  Ihnfc what everyone here is talking about. Everytime I have a problem with a mouse, keyboard or headset or anything else from them, they are so eager to send a replacement free of charge. I have a G710+ (which they don't make anymore since it's really old) and I had a problem with it and they told me that they couldn't send out a new one(because they don't make them anymore) BUT that I could get $150 towards one of their newer gaming keyboards which btw is enough to get any gaming kb on their website except for the G910 and it was all completely free of charge. I ended up getting the G613 and just ended up selling it to buy a refurbished G710+ from Newegg. I ended up making $75 in the process. I even had a $40 mouse (G403) and a $70 keyboard(G410) break because my monitor fell on them. I told Logitech and again they sent me a replacement for both free of charge.  I had a Logitech G430(Gaming headset) that I lost the dongle for which btw I bought refurbished for way lower than retail price and again, they sent me a replacement for the entire headset(not just the dongle) and once again free of charge. I don't even know how they afford to do this but they do and it is why I try to buy all my peripherals from Logitech. I have a Blue mic(which is owned by Logitech), a Saitek flight stick and throttle(also owned by Logitech) and a G502 and G710+ right now. The only thing I don't have that is Logitech is a headset but that is purely because they don't make high end headsets like Sennheiser does. I made multiple accounts with Logitech just to make sure they don't pick customers at random to give the special treatment to and that isn't the case. Time and time again they just replace the product no matter what.

  Tried to order, impossible to pay. Cancelled order, got lost in an online circle of misery, No contact information, no e-mail, no telephone and once again simply could not work the dreadful website. Made a complaint on social media. Sometime later...I'm contacted by Logitech and asked to describe my issues, why would I spend my valuable time helping them work to repair their own web site? surely they check the efficiency of their own site? 3 weeks later and I'm now receiving e-mails asking me to complete my order. In summary: dreadful web site, torturous experience. No help or support to make the order but too much contact after the order is cancelled. Get it together Logitech.

Logitech customer services followed the case closely and I was receiving a daily call with progress update.

  If I could give zero stars, I would. I bought a Logitech crayon for my IPAD. It worked great when it arrived. After attempting to recharge, the pen would not hold the charge. We tried different chargers to no avail. The green light refused to stay on. I spent 2 hours working with Logitech, jumping through hoops with regard to my IOS version, when all that was wrong was that the pen wouldn't charge. After 2 hours, she took all of the info to replace the pen and said I'd receive an email about the replacement within 72 hours. 2 days later, I received an email, asking me to do all of the same, idiotic stuff I had already done with the representative 2 days before.

  This company is 100% ridiculous. I have a slim Logi folio that I purchased less than a year ago during Black Friday for an iPad. It was NOT cheap - I believe it cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 on sale. The regular price was more than that. Well, less than a year later, so still under warranty, a piece is coming off of it. The problem is that I don’t actually know what function the piece serves. It’s a little strip across the top part of the iPad section of the case when it’s in portrait mode. It could be purely cosmetic or it could be an essential part of the case. I searched and couldn’t figure it out though so I contacted Logitech to ask before taking all the steps to file a claim. Instead of answering my one sentence simple question, they sent me a two page form email with very involved instructions on filing a claim against the warranty. Of course this irritated me. I just want my question answered first. If this is a cosmetic issue with the case then I’m not going to claim on the warranty. As long as it doesn’t affect the function I’m fine with this piece doing whatever. But they didn’t simply answer my question. I don’t think they even really read my question or looked at the support ticket at all, because part of what the form email they sent requested was a dated picture depicting the damage, WHICH I SENT IN WITH THE SUPPORT TICKET!!! The photo attached to my question on that ticket clearly shows the date and the damage to the item. All in all, the customer service is terrible. I ended up responding to their response asking that they answer my question first. NO RESPONSE BACK. I don’t think this company is interested in providing actual customer service. They don’t seem to care about their customers at all. I won’t be buying any Logitech item in the future ever again. EVER. AGAIN. I sincerely mean that. I’ll go out of my way to avoid them after how ridiculous they’re being with this. A company that can’t perform basic customer service tasks isn’t going to have me as a customer.

  I have a harmony one hub remote. Great product and reliable for over 5 years. However when some issues arose the CS response was I should buy a new one for 400 plus and here is a coupon for 10 percent off. The reality is that the battery went. For 25 bucks and two Diya to deliver...new battery open up the remote with ease. Unplug the old battery, plug in the new one and back in business.

  The least durable mice on the planet. You are lucky if you can use one straight for 6 months. Seriously I havent been able to. Either a mouse button will give out or the mouse sensitivlity would be all over the place. And thats with regular use, but if you drop the mouse with two feet that mouse if done for. And I am speaking from experience of owning more than 10 Logitech mice over the past 5 years.Dont get me wrong the mouse has nice features, that Logitech probably have patented, because otherwise nobody would buy their stuff. My recommendation, if you are going for a proper mouse or a keyboard, go with Razer (I cant speak for other products as I havent tried anything from other manufacturers).

They don't tell me exactly what they need to fulfill my service request, but just keep sending me same response ""requested information is not complete"" and they don't tell me what is exactly missing. I've been spending so much time and sending few emails back and forth and nothing is solved. I think they just want to waste my time and don't want to fix their problem.

  I've bought a Logitech MX Master and recently I started having issues with the left button. I first contacted Logitech support on the 24th of September and explained the situation and asked for a repair center in Portugal. Today is the 16th of October and I still haven't got a solution or an answer about the repair center. It's just unacceptable!!!

  This company is 100% ridiculous. I have a slim Logi folio that I purchased less than a year ago during Black Friday for an iPad. It was NOT cheap - I believe it cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 on sale. The regular price was more than that. Well, less than a year later, so still under warranty, a piece is coming off of it. The problem is that I don’t actually know what function the piece serves. It’s a little strip across the top part of the iPad section of the case when it’s in portrait mode. It could be purely cosmetic or it could be an essential part of the case. I searched and couldn’t figure it out though so I contacted Logitech to ask before taking all the steps to file a claim. Instead of answering my one sentence simple question, they sent me a two page form email with very involved instructions on filing a claim against the warranty. Of course this irritated me. I just want my question answered first. If this is a cosmetic issue with the case then I’m not going to claim on the warranty. As long as it doesn’t affect the function I’m fine with this piece doing whatever. But they didn’t simply answer my question. I don’t think they even really read my question or looked at the support ticket at all, because part of what the form email they sent requested was a dated picture depicting the damage, WHICH I SENT IN WITH THE SUPPORT TICKET!!! The photo attached to my question on that ticket clearly shows the date and the damage to the item. All in all, the customer service is terrible. I ended up responding to their response asking that they answer my question first. NO RESPONSE BACK. I don’t think this company is interested in providing actual customer service. They don’t seem to care about their customers at all. I won’t be buying any Logitech item in the future ever again. EVER. AGAIN. I sincerely mean that. I’ll go out of my way to avoid them after how ridiculous they’re being with this. A company that can’t perform basic customer service tasks isn’t going to have me as a customer.

  Shocking, Appalling treatment of a long term Logitech customer. I have an X56-Hotas flight stick its under warranty still but has an issue with it, I logged a ticket with Logitech and provided the original purchase e-mail with payment on etc... I also supplied multiple other details they requested. I call them around 15 times and they kept saying they are working on my claim only to receive an e-mail today stating ""your warranty claim has been rejected because the device has already been registered"" I couldn't believe it I registered the device when I purchased it directly from Logitech!!!!! grrrrr so frustrating they want me to send a video of me holding the device with a note on it and the ticket number written on the note! I feel like a criminal in a line up! absolutely awful experience and customer service I really cannot believe the lack of consideration and lack of professionalism they have shown, avoid Logitech at all costs!

  Frustrating is an understatement trying to get support. I'm ask a simple question about a function of a product yet instead of trying to help it's like talking to a robot parrot. How many times do I have to provide a model and serial number before I actually get a human response instead of what seems to be an automated email template. I'm running out of patience. They keep closing the case. How much time am I supposed to waste trying to find out a simple answer on how to switch from Bluetooth to a dongle for a cheap media keyboard and track pad. Tempted to send it back to them in small pieces. It's 4am and this is almost harassment now. The product isn't even listed on their menus for support. This is ridiculous

  I have a harmony one hub remote. Great product and reliable for over 5 years. However when some issues arose the CS response was I should buy a new one for 400 plus and here is a coupon for 10 percent off. The reality is that the battery went. For 25 bucks and two Diya to deliver...new battery open up the remote with ease. Unplug the old battery, plug in the new one and back in business. So great product but shame on Logitech for encouraging more crap to be discarded when they could sell the battery and extend the life of a great product. Oh and save the environment a bit of pain too.

  The least durable mice on the planet. You are lucky if you can use one straight for 6 months. Seriously I havent been able to. Either a mouse button will give out or the mouse sensitivlity would be all over the place. And thats with regular use, but if you drop the mouse with two feet that mouse if done for. And I am speaking from experience of owning more than 10 Logitech mice over the past 5 years.Dont get me wrong the mouse has nice features, that Logitech probably have patented, because otherwise nobody would buy their stuff. My recommendation, if you are going for a proper mouse or a keyboard, go with Razer (I cant speak for other products as I havent tried anything from other manufacturers).

  Bought a Logitech G430. Geat headset, very strong, great quality, great sound, great bass, breathes, comfortable... BUT, there is an issue that Logitech has decided to ignore, despite this issue appearing around 2014-2015: The driver causes the sound to reverse randomly when using the headset which makes it impossible to use to play because there is no way to fix this, and in certain sound location is very important. So Logitech is closing their eyes on this like we would just buy a new headset. And this is issue that makes this headset unusable will never be fixed because they don't care. Before gaming was a trend, they made the best equipment regarding PC, no flaws. But now they decided to go cheap and full profit. They disgust me, such an issue on a $80 headest that they KEEP SELLING is unacceptable. Go MadCatz guys, I've own a MadCatz RAT3 for 7 years no issue.

I contact Logitech support in May, 2019, and they asked me to request a replacement through my vendor (Amazon), and if the problem persisted, they would step in. Amazon replaced my product immediately but it had the exact same issue. I contacted Logitech again and they have been giving me the runaround for almost 3 months now. They keep asking me to run ridiculous tests like replacing batteries and reinstalling software (on a physical problem, unbalanced scrolling wheel), changing my customer reps, giving me different case numbers, and asking me to re-explain the problem even though I am replying to the same e-mail and referencing all case numbers I've received. The last e-mail I received was on August 13th and they said ""[...]this will be pending for approval and we will keep you updated within the next 24-48 hours.""

  This has to be the worst customer service I have experienced - they simply won't respond! Many of the keys on my brand-new keyboard stopped working immediately after starting to use it. Looking at forum messages, it is clear that this is a common problem and not specific to me. After a long time debating the issue with Logitech Customer Support, they sent me out a new one: it had exactly the same problem! I know it is a problem with the product and not my device, because I have tested it on multiple devices. For 6 months now I have been trying to get a refund, but am being stalled and ignored by Logitech Customer Support - despite them actually agreeing to send me a refund, I simply can't get them to actually do this!

  This has honestly been the worst customer service experience I've had. It initially started out fine. I purchased a mouse/keyboard combo and I needed a replacement mouse. It took about a month of back and forth to get what I needed but ultimately they sent me a replacement and I was satisfied. I then received a bill from the shipping company. And they've since changed their ticketing system. I have had no luck getting a hold of anyone there and I keep receiving the same automated messages. The first says they're waiting for me to reply to keep the case open, which I have done four times. The second says my case is updated and comes from Erma. Also received four times.

I contacted customer support through their online report submission page not expecting much, mainly because I thought the camera was out of warranty. They responded after a few days and then stuck with me while we tried to sort out what was wrong. They agreed that it was a hardware issue with the camera and are sending me a replacement.

They stated it was left by my back door, I don’t even have a back door so something fishy going on there. This is when it went downhill. I had to make multiple calls to Logitech and the delivery company. It took about 2 weeks for delivery company to admit it was missing, Logitech were informed of the same and yet it took another 2 months before a replacement was sent. I sent numerous emails to Logitech most of which were ignored. I asked them to call me, and nothing, I was told y ticket was escalated, and nothing happened. I would email almost daily, and no response. I must have received about 5 or 6 emails in that time asking if my issue was resolved so they can close the call.

  Top notch products from this company. Bought a mouse a few months back and never regretted it. It's tactile and sleek to the touch, very responsive. I didn't even expect such quality from a 40$ mouse. Will definitely buy more of their products in the future.

  One star is one too many. I bought a defective key pad on Amazon from them. It took 3 months and scores of email exchanges before I finally got my refund. I believe their ""customer service"" policy is to procrastinate, stonewall, and stall until the customer just gives up on the issue. Worse customer service I have ever experienced in my entire adult life. And I'm 74!

  About 2 weeks ago the ""w"" key stopped working on my Logitech K800 keyboard. I have had this keyboard about 2.25 years and it has exceeded my expectations up until the issue. I registered this keyboard with Logitech support back when I originally purchased it. I noticed there was a 3 year, limited warranty so I contacted Logitech Customer Support and explained my problem. Within a couple of days I received a response from Angelica who was assigned my case. She sent me a list of things to do as a work-around to test for restoration of full functionality as well as a request to confirm my mailing address. None of the things worked so I let her know. One of the items on the list was to download the unifying wireless software so I could use multiple devices through a single fob/USB port - I didn't realize I could do this - it freed up a port on my laptop because my Logitech mouse can be combined with the keyboard on a single fob. I let Angelica know that none of the tasks on the list restored the key function and she immediately responded to let me know that Logitech was sending me a new, replacement keyboard. I did not have to return the broken one. I received the new keyboard today. So - this entire transaction took only about 2 weeks.I am so impressed with this company.

  The product I bought is not ""clickless"" or ""silent"" as it is featured to be. The mouse emits the same amount of noise as a regular mouse would. I honestly feel scammed for my money by Logitech. All their M-line mice are marketed as ""silent"" and ""90% noise reduction"" but this is absurd. Don't even mind paying a little more for the thing if it would work properly. Guess they don't mind losing long-time customers.

  The warranty of this company is absolute joke. I've reported faulty mouse I bought on amazon like more than a month ago.No one is doing anything about it. Customer service is trying to doge me by not comming back to me with a straight answer. Logitech has NO intention to follow up on the warranty they are promoting, BE WARNED!!!

  Logitech may have a three year warranty but they are completely unwilling to honour it. I purchased a logitech wireless keyboard from John Lewis. It failed outside of John Lewis's warranty but within the 3 year warranty of Logitech. I had complete proof of purchase including delivery date and payment method. Logitech refused to honour the warranty because they said it was not a vat receipt. I tried discussing this with them they refused to honour the warranty. Avoid this company

  I just called logitech.com about a USB wireless receiving unit plug for my logitech MX Mouse. I accidentally dropped my laptop and it landed right on the USB receiving unit plug. Needless to say it no longer works so I called Logitech to buy another. Their Support team is so thoughtful that the technician named Andrew  offered to send me a new one free. I have never had a company treat me this good since  Craftsman tools at Sears, back in the good old days. Thank you Logitech for hiring such thoughtful employees, and thank you again Andrew for your professional treatment of your customer.

  For years a user of Logitech never experienced any troubles or whatsoever. Purchased a C922 Pro Stream webcam a few months back for my birthday and everything worked fine until recently when it seems not to connect anymore. I tried to solve the problem myself by browsing the internet and watching videos and even with updating my system. ( Tried to plug in the webcam at 2 other computers ) and the issue continued. Nothing worked, filed a claim and delivered all the details such as the serial numbers and proof of payment. They are not taking me seriously and I need to capture a video with me and my device with a handwritten note. Total nonsense and it will make you feel not taken seriously at all. I recommend my close friends not to buy from them and switch brands.  Here is how they act on claims: http:/ /prntscr.com /kyayov

  Awful costumer service. They promise to get back to you within two days and take nearly a week. You put in an order and 20 days later they still havent shipped it! Then you request to cancel the order.. No reply... You request it again becaue you dont want to support such a lousy and unorganized company that clearly thinks nothing of their costumers. Then they decide to ship it before getting back to you so you have no choise but to support them. NEVER AGAIN! All they have to do is care, its not that difficult.

  Please do not use UPS for deliveries. They said they attempted delivery and yet no one turned up to leave a calling card and no one appeared on CCTV. Parents were home in the front room which is next to the front door and the dog didn't bark.

  Loved my Rollerball M570 however the wireless transmitter was damaged and Logitech does not even let me ask if I can get a new transmitter. Absolutely the worst site for customer care/questions. Now do I spend anoher $50 on their product that they won't even let me ask a question about??? probably no

  Revols Logitech purchased Revols a while ago. After a long time waiting my Revols arrived but didn’t work. After four requests to tech support, I finally got a reply giving some different set up instructions. Still don’t work, another three contacts to tech support and NO RESPONSE. If you are expecting to need any level of technical support, buy elsewhere

  I bought a wireless headset on sale and learned several days later that logitech made a *mistake* and had to cancel my order. This made me miss the sale on the product and they are still holding my money. Contacting their customer support is horrible half the time the live chat button is missing or greyed out and their email response is unacceptable. I got an email a week later how they can't deal with me because they are too busy. Logitech is still holding my money and I have had to make a dispute with my credit card company because they still have not given me my money back. On top of all this their call support does not deal with orders so they tell you to go somewhere else leaving me high and dry with no product and no money. Do not buy from logitech they will send you nothing and keep your money.

  Logitech G560 Speakers look good sound ok but DO NOT BUY THEM! The software is totally useless and I suspect the firmware has problems, Logitech are aware of the problems but do nothing about it. The volume can not be controlled at low levels on any input, impossible to use at night as every input is too loud. When you turn them on there is no sound, you have to randomly click on anything in the software to make them come on, and when they do it's at full volume. You can not choose what input plays, the software control for this is hidden and when you do find it, it won't work. Simply useless and over complicated software, and firmware that can not control the volume. Logitech are a big company with huge profits, you would think they could afford to pay for an I.T. department that can make a pair of speakers work properly.

  CAUTION NOT TO BUY: Logitech K480 Keyboard PROBLEMS: * Bluetooth ONLY (BT) * BT ONLY works within an operating system, so if anything happens to the operating system, the keyboard will NOT work. * You can NOT access BIOS with BT. * You can NOT dual boot to select an operating system with BT. * You can NOT install an operating system with BT. * BT has constant drop outs, lags, needing to pair to work. * Your BT devices MIGHT be seen by your neighbors, who MIGHT be able access such.  I returned the K480, which has excellent built quality, and exchanged it for the K780 which has WiFi and BT, and is fully functional. Avoid the K480 and buy the K780 ... unless you want endless frustration. Logitech is an excellent computer hardware company, that at times make mistakes, like the K480 being Bluetooth only. ... Bluetooth - this is a technology which should not exist, because of the inherent limitations. Avoid BT or be prepared to be frustrated endlessly.

  Great customer support with little difficulties I purchased a gaming keyboard 1.5 years ago and unfortunately I damaged a little part of the keyboard while cleaning.  I contacted Logitech support asking for advise what I can do. In the beginning the support was quite frustrating because they just sent me templates which haven't matched my request properly.  After some mails the support understood my struggle and thankfully they were able to help me.  All in all I'm a super happy customer for ages now and would always recommend purchasing a Logitech product! Thanks Logitech!

  They allowed the support of many of their TV web cameras to be deactivated by Microsoft, and they didn't offer any alternative solution's. So we're stuck with perfectly working camera that won't work for anything now simply because of support issues. What a joke of a company. They decide how long our product will last, and then they really expect me to go out and buy another of their cameras to replace my previous one. really?

  I just want to cancel my order before it is shipped. All of the phones numbers are unavailable at this time and it is so difficult to navigate and use the forums. I don't even know how to post anything and googling how to yields no results. I sent a support ticket (I think, their entire support page is confusing. I clicked on the category to help me with online orders and then it asks for me to type in the serial number of the mouse that I have yet to receive). This entire experience has been horrible and I will never buy off their website again.

  Brand new keyboard with 4 year battery came with only 80% charge. Customer support directed me to buy a new battery and replace it. When I suggested they mail me a new battery they refused and suggested I return the keyboard to the store. Was going to buy UE speakers until I found out they area also made by Logitech.

  Bought a c922 webcam, no support. No software. Not even comparable to the c270 I had in terms of ability to use. I commented on their forums on like minded posts, and found they had banned me from commenting. Instead of even responding to my open case, they banned me. Terrible company. Best to avoid, and I do not recommend the c922 webcam, it is only supported in OBS at the specified details. Otherwise, you have a run of the mill webcam, that costs 3 times as much as one for the same specs, elsewhere.

  Really Great Quality Products! I have multiple products from Logitech but I am mostly happy with there mice it is just amazing and really great to use. They are also really affordable. But sadly their webcams were not that great I had some terrible experiences with one of my webcams and it just broke without any reason.

  Stay away. yes the marketing is very nice, but the support is simply a myth. Their TV cam stopped working and they only propose to send you a basic webcam. A 20$ piece of crap for a 200+$ TV cam. The most interesting is that you can not talk to them over the phone and their support web refuses you submit a ticket for this device. Again, they are plenty of interesting and cheaper alternatives to this company. Take your time and avoid them.

  Again, another company that does not give a s+=t! I have a mouse that has lasted 14 months until the receiver stopped working. I emailed to ask whether there was a solution to fix this. After 2 weeks, I have got nowhere but the bloke (boglarka) just asked the same questions over and over again. The mouse is fine the receiver doesn't connect. 4 emails later. Please provide receipt of where the product was bought and when. I emailed this! These have a 2 year warranty. To be told it's out of warranty because the shop had either sold me old stock or they can't be bothered to replace a £20 mouse. Absolutely terrible.

  This is the first time I have ever written a review online, and the reason being logitech's after services is appalling, trying to claim a warranty over the z906 speakers for over a month now, and it's pretty much the WORST experience I have ever had to go through, I was asked to send basically everything, started off with proof of purchase, then oh you need to send us a picture of the serial number with a note of my claim number next to it, as if that wasn't enough, we need a video now of you explaining what was wrong with it, considering these speakers weigh a tonne, so taking it in and out of the box was a right pain. Only for them to ask me to re-pack the speakers and send it to the Netherlands. It's been 3 weeks now, haven't heard nothing since, tracking indicated speakers were delivered within 2 days of sending it. Yet nothing. Rubbish company

  I love my G13 keyboard and my G402 mouse. I really like the Logitech Gaming Software v8.96 these run under.  So I decided to buy the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick, thinking that it would also run under the Logitech Gaming Software v8.96, as per the mouse and keyboard. The version that the joystick (and all the joysticks that Logitech currently manufacture, currently advertise and currently sell) is the Logitech Gaming Software v5.10. This version was the same software as the keyboard/mouse software but one that hasn't been updated since June 2010, meaning that you must run two different versions of the same software if you have a joystick and mouse/keyboard by Logitech. And as the v5.10 has not been updated since Windows 7, Logitech can not even guarantee that this version will be safe to run under Windows 10. Their customer service is some of the worst I have experienced, using lies and excuses to do nothing to help customers and refusing to apolgise for their mistakes, lies, excuses, terrible turnaround times etc. Will I be purchasing more Logitech products? No, not even if Logitech where the last peripheral manufacture on the planet, not even if I was given the products for free.

  My love hate relationship with Logitech. I love their products, mice and software in particular. I have an ongoing issue though with the quality as there is always either a double click issue or a failing spring (won't hold down even when pressed) in the right or left or both click buttons. I try to get my warranty honoured and indeed it was once and I did get a replacement but the work that went into getting it was such that I could probably have earned more from an employer and bought another mouse. I have the same issue again, and I have just bought another Logitech mouse to replace it. I am putting in the warranty claim again but haven't heard anything in nearly 2 weeks. I am not holding out much hope of a replacement. So, as it is now, I average about £8 per month for mice from Logitech if you break it down into a bill, which it is really. Once I find another manufacturer whos mice are as nice to use and with the simple configuration software, Logitech won't sell me any more products.

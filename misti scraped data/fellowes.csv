Fellowes,Office Supplies,5 stars: Excellent,"My shredder stopped working after 2years. Contacted the company directly. A replacement was sent without fuss as under  a 3 year warranty, no fuss, no quibbles. So refreshing.

                Fellowes 300CL. This has to be the worst paper shredder ever made. The first one we received it was loud and and didn't work well at all. When called a week later to be refunded I was told they don't just refund someone will be out to look at it. Well they came out and looked at it and something on the machine was bad. Our company wanted to just get rid of this shredder but they had to send us another one. Promising us we would be so happy with it. Finally weeks later after poor communication we were sent another one. What a hassle it was to get it into the box witch the movers wouldn't do. Once the new one was received we set it up and it has been nothing but problems also.It does not shut off and if you don't check it important things are left in the tray UN shredded. We even had a credit card that was shredded and left the chip in the trap. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!

                I purchased an office shredder with a cash back offer, I followed the online instructions to claim back the offer. After weeks of waiting Fellowes have  (welched on the deal) replied back stating  somehow the information I have given  is not considered a valid proof of purchase.  Try looking deeper Fellowes.  This was entered via a link by Fellowes. Last purchase you get off me Fellowes!

                I bought two Saturn 3i su125 laminating machines and both have broken.Customer Service was more than willing to replace with the same machine. I offered to pay the difference and get a better one, they claimed I may have used it for more than it could handle. I agreed with them but it didn't make sense for me to try the same model a third time. They wouldn't allow me to ""upgrade"" and pay difference. So I called THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE and Janet Moore Not only replaced it with a model that cost 3x the price of the original, BUT SHE DID IT FOR FREE!  My daughter is a teacher and she will appreciate the upgrade to a laminator we have paid for twice. Janet went above and beyond to help a teacher in need. thank you Janet!

                Purchased a Followes H-6c and after only 6 months it jammed shredding a credit card. Contacted customer services and they asked how frequently I oil it to which I replied. Not heard anything else back from Fellowes and they have just decided to ignore me. Does a warranty or customer service mean nothing? Consumer Direct is the next port of call.

                Super happy with a new Fellowes DS3!  I had an older shredder that would get jammed and was much louder than this one. Shreds thick credit card marketing mail with plastic replicas without any issues. Very easy to operate and clean.

                after a fault appeared on our shredder, I contacted customer services, they  told us to forward proof of purchase, and within two days we received a replacement, which was an upgraded model as the present one was not made anymore. this company goes way beyond  expectations, and I  would  always buy from them if I was looking to purchase anything they make.

                Our P-58Cs shredder suddenly gave up the ghost 3 months past the 2 year warranty having only been used occasionally to shred sensitive household papers.  I e-mailed Fellowes asking if they could offer any guidance to get it working again and had a reply about 20 minutes later asking for my phone number so they could talk me through a recovery process.  About an hour after I replied, I was talking to Julie who, satisfied the machine had expired, said she would e-mail a form for me to fill in.  This I did and received another mail to inform me a replacement machine would be despatched the next day.  It was delivered the day after that.   The replacement machine is factory reconditioned and as a result only has a 90 day guarantee period but considering I have a working shredder again for nothing, I am extremely satisfied.  that's the way to look after your customers.

Brother,Technology,1 star: Bad,"While I have recently purchased several Brother products from printers to sewing machines, I had never could get the 15% off coupon they advertise.  I tried several times and never received the email with the CODE.  I contacted Brother directly - their customer service response was a huge disappointment!  They are not even offering to help - FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!

Brother,Technology,1 star: Bad," 
                Absolutely the worst, incompetent service I have ever seen. I had purchased a new HL-L6200DW on 12/2/19 which is working fine. I added a Lower tray for dual printing on today 1/24/2020. It didn't work as it wouldn't communicate with the laptop/printer. I called Brother customer service and got ""Billy"" on the phone. This was at 10:53 am. He took me thru all kinds of trial and error which none of them worked. He then said he would like to talk with someone to get more information and would like to call me back. That was after he guessed at what to do for 38mins and 54 secs. He did call me back at 11:38am and spent another 31mins and 25secs deleting printers and reinstalling drives etc etc. I was getting upset for something he should have know to do that should only take 10-15mins. He couldn't figure it out. Then he said that he would pass it on up and have someone call me back. I asked when and he said by the end of the day!! Well it's now 4:35 pm and no return call. Thank goodness I have a Geek Squad account and I called them as soon as i hung up from Brother. They fixed the issue in 10 minutes. Brother should be totally ashamed of their tech services dept. Why even have one? Pathetic!! I wasted over an hour with foolishness.

                ABSOLUTELY THE WORST - the worst customer service and support EVER! I mean they are not at all helpful - in any way! My printer stopped functioning wirelessly - I was on hold forever - customer service agent was not qualified - so frustrated - I am going to buy HP - shame on Brother.

                My 18 months old sewing machine stopped working for no reason i could figure. I contacted Brother Sewing machines UK who collected the broken one from my home and gave me back a new one, at no cost to me. Thank you Brother

                Took forever to set up wireless.  The Brother ""support"" online could not be written more opaquely.  Seriously, instructions in hieroglyphics would have been just as helpful. Every single page comes out creased.  Every single page.  So bad that you could not send a letter printed on this machine.  I have tried to adjust the tray and troubleshoot per their instructions -- NOTHING WORKS.  This machine is worthless.

Brother,Technology,1 star: Bad," 
                I have spent the last several hours attempting to setup my Brother printer for the current location I am at;  my printer is offline and cannot see the network.   I finally exhorted to the ""brother support line"" to be bandied about between just answer; expecting that Brother can take the time to serve its customers, brother customer service which sends me repeatedly to some info on machine questions.  When these are answered I am sent to options to try page, all of which I have tried repeatedly.  I answer ""not helpful"" to be sent to the beginning without any option for an alternative, even slightly more effective one. Even tho I have been loath to try Brother for bad experience in earlier years, I decided to give it another shot as I know that there products have improved.   To this point, I have been extremely happy with the printer.   However, to not be able to get customer support for the unit, this gives me grave concern about my holdup when I have a serious issue under firm time constraints.  Lynda Barker

Brother,Technology,1 star: Bad," 
                I recently purchased a scan n cut and after two uses it quite working properly due to issues with the mat. Come to find out there was a glitch in the machine that could only be corrected by linking the machine to your computer. I am not technically savvy so this was difficult for me so I enlisted the help of someone who was. Long story short, there are no directions in the user instructions on how to Do this. Also there was no Cord included in the box to connect tovkmouter. The assistance at brother was some of the poorest I’ve ever seen Do NOT do business with this company

                Bought a Brother Printer today from PC World with a £60 Cashback Promotion.  It seems to be impossible to claim the cashback back from the Brother Website.  Regretting buying the printer now.

Brother,Technology,2 stars: Poor," 
                Printer OK - support is useless. Spent 38 minutes to get my scanner to work - worked in past.  Plugged and unpluggled, downloaded, switched connectors, slots, etc. Then just said ""contact your computer support"" - that was it. Didn't go through any of the ""scanner config"", nothing else. Most of the time was on hold or downloading.

Brother,Technology,2 stars: Poor," 
                Called customer service number +1 (855) 357-5207, twice. Technical support out of india unable to help and directed me to ""customer service"" number which was pure advertisements! It was very disappointing.

                I wish I hadn't bought the Brother DCP 1510 printer.  I bought it because of price, although it wasn't the very cheapest, and because I wanted a mono printer.  I was tired of buying 4 colours of expensive ink when I nearly always printed in black and white. It does print, I'll give it that, but the only interface is through buttons on the machine itself and a TINY LCD SCREEN which is ALMOST UNREADABLE.  There is no interface through whatever device you're using.  This is EXTREMELY ANNOYING.  Do not buy this machine unless you like frustration.

                I bought a Brother Scan N Cut just under 2 years ago, suddenly it developed a fault, I emailed the company and had a reply back within 12 hours, Jonathon was brilliant! He said it needed to come in and be checked over, I asked if it would cost me, he said they would do free of charge as they offered a TWO YEAR parts and warranty service!!! They collected the machine free, when I wanted it collected, it was gone barely 2 days and I received a message to say it was on its way back all better!!! They replaced parts, cleaned it and even when it came back with a missing stylus, no problem, Jonathon again on the case and popped a new one in the post - job done!!! What a fab company to deal with - people are quick to criticise but not enough praise is given - well heres a 5* review for you Brother - you were the business!!! THANK YOU! Fab, quick, efficient and friendly customer service!!! Jonathon did you proud!

                Bought a Brother laser printer (DCP1610) in March,good price,worked well.Since buying it I moved to France.Printer stopped working, contacted Brother UK who said they have a 'europe wide warranty',but I'd need to bring it back to the UK or contact Brother France. Needless to say, Brother France response was 'not bought here, not interested', so warranty useless. More landfill. Just ordered a Samsung (HP) replacement which I should have bought first time around (they do offer a proper warranty)

                I'm not sure why these reviews are so long because I had a great customer service experience with Nikolai this morning. He picked up quickly, I was on hold less than five minutes and he professionally and competently troubleshot my issue. I was worried I would have to buy a new printer, we got a ton of use out of it in the 18 months we owned it, but thankfully Brother's customer service was able to resolve the issue to my full satisfaction and we are back up and running in less than one hour from a firmware failure to phone call to resolution.

                Poor, slow, condescending customer service in my opinion regarding printers. Chat email does NOT work!! and if you do raise enough of a stink to get a call back, the ‘fix’ didn’t work and they can’t get you off the phone fast enough.   I will NEVER, EVER buy another Brother product based on the ‘Customer Service’ experience.

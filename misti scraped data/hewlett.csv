                Only gave 1 star because there is nothing any lower!!! Bought a house printer and signed up for instant ink....1 week later ink runs out and the shipment that was sent 22 days ago(?) according to my account still has not arrived at my home! Took over a week to get to actually speak to someone on the phone to be told that nobody is qualified there to speak to me regarding my query and that someone would call me back in 48 working hours..??? It is 16.29 on Friday afternoon which puts me on to Tuesday next week...I have had use of the printer for 1 week of the month that I have owned it for and have suffered the worst customer service that I have ever had the misfortune to try to deal with...(and I have been a Vodafone customer for 10+ yrs at that...!!!) Absolutely RAGING angry with the incompetence and ignorance of the people I have spent a week and a half trying to speak to! I feel sick I‚Äôm that angry!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

                In January I bought a basic PC to work from home. HP Pavilion i3 4GB 1TB Desktop PC 318/4033.  It was replacing a trusty old Dell which operated Windows 7 and I was persuaded that I needed to move on.  This PC is described on argos.co.uk as 'powerful' and 'exceeds expectations'. Sadly it is the WORST PC I have ever had. Their support people have performed various remote checks (they say it's all fine) and advised me to do complete reset which I have done. It remains painfully slow.  HP help staff have tried to blame it on Microsoft - ultimately this PC is not capable of operating basic MS office and day to work with documents and websites; I click and there is even a wait before the never ending spinning cursor appears. I have spent hours and hours trying to solve this or just waiting for the machine to respond. I have asked HP to send me a machine that works but - no response. I'm planning to unplug it and go back to the old Dell.

                Yet again HP excel. They have managed to send the incorrect colour cartridge pack from their store, despite it being ordered from within the printer app itself! E mail produced referral to telophone line which is unobtainable due to volumes Covid 19 traffic.<br/>HP store out of stock of product. Obtained by return (genuine product) from 3rd party supplier.<br/>Due to lack of assistance &amp; communication  I will be taking the financial hit on the original order, but will not be using HP store again under any circumstances,<br/>.

                I am in the UK and bought an HP Envy Photo printer 6234 at the end of August 2019. I then went on holiday overseas until the 6th November 2019 so I hadn't used it. Since my return in November I have hardly used it as its just a home printer. In March 2020 the cartridges jammed and despite many conversations with HP technical support in India they agreed they needed to replace it. The replacement arrived about a week later and when I opened it I realized it wasn't a new one! When I asked I was told they just send out refurbished models. Surely not correct? When I tried to set it up, it wouldn't connect to my Wi Fi. Again hours spent on the phone to different people at HP in India  all telling me to do the same things that I'd tried with other HP employees whom I'd spoken to. In the end they said they would replace it again.....but not a new one. Yesterday 6th April I spoke with one of their people in Lisbon Portugal who argued with me about the timing on his email for him to call me. Such a rude man. Again saying they would not give me a new printer or refund my money. I said I wanted to contact someone much higher than him and he said that he would email their contact details. This has not happened.

                Purchased a Hewlett Packard printer with a ¬£50 cashback offer. Despite sending every piece of documentation supplied, Receipt and Delivery Note they won't pay. There is nothing more that could be sent. Blatant trickery and wriggling out of an offer. Will be returning for a full refund.

                Support/ after care is awful! Be Warned.<br/>Last week I purchased for my home a HP Envy Photo 7830 with 3 years support, and also ordered additional cartridges for when the ones that come with it run out. I followed the setup instructions and installed the cartridges. In the screen it said, cartridge missing. I contacted support and followed their instructions which included updating the printer software. Still same problem. I then tried the two spare cartridges I had purchased. Same problem. Spoke with support via WhatsApp, good idea to use WhatsApp you'd think but they take an age to respond and simple diagnostics take hours. Eventually I was told ‚ÄúI see that the copper contacts are completely removed and there is no nozzle part. Please purchase the new cartridges and it should work fine‚Äù. By this time, I‚Äôd spent five hours trying different things.<br/>Not happy about this as I had two sets of cartridges and had been very careful when installing, but perhaps that was the case. Ordered two more cartridges. Another ¬£30 and guess what same problem. I‚Äôm loathed to spend another several hours looking into this, sick of the lack of customer service and just want to return. But told‚Ä¶. I cannot return, I am a consumer and only purchased a week ago and told I could not speak with them on the phone. Also, they will never take back three sets of opened cartridges. They simply don‚Äôt care enough to sort the issue; I think the suggestion to order more cartridges was to get rid of me.  <br/>5 hours not happy about a simple printer I wanted for my home.

                HP Reverb VR headset<br/>Despite HP having issues with the first release and ""fixing "" them I can tell you now that this is not the full truth as Ive had 3 of them. the 1st one suffered from MURA where a large percentage of pixels dont display correctly so you get a looking through slightly dirty glass effect. The other 2 were non functioning. Clearly HP are aware of these faults and choose to use the public as their quality control. I did ask if they could actually carry out quality control before they send a replacement , and was told they were ""unable"" to do this ! I asked for a refund instead. What a shame this could have been the best headset on the market if it works and they had not decided to use that dreadful twin cable that feels like your attached by high voltage cable instead of a cord . <br/>They have also disabled writing product reviews leaving mainly good ones for the Reverb.<br/><br/>Well thats the last time I purchase a HP product ,.

                We purchased a Hewlett packard 2600 all in one printer last June. In general it works okay but the print plan we purchased with it is a sham.  We haven‚Äôt had new ink for some time and the company are telling us that this is due to our printer not being connected to the internet.<br/>As Most of our printing relates to attachments to emails etc we know that it is connected. The company insist that it must be our broadband provider that is at fault yet we  have no issues otherwise with the broadband reception and as mentioned all our printing from the internet is fine.<br/>We are now exasperated with HP and have requested a cancellation of the plan. This was on the 9th February and we have heard nothing in response. We sent two reminders and they have gone unanswered also. <br/>As we all know the measure of a good business is the aftersales service and fixing of problems.  What we are experiencing is the exact opposite of this.  <br/>We expect HP to cancel any charges from the cancellation date and perhaps send us some free ink as they haven‚Äôt supplied any for months and printing quality is getting very weak.

                How on earth has this company managed to survive with such poor after-sales service is beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>The MS Office software I purchased with my laptop wasn't included in my order. They emailed to say that it was included based on the shipping weight of the package (it wasn't!), effectively accusing me of lying.<br/><br/>They don't work on weekends and are proving impossible to get in touch with to resolve. Avoid HP!! They are bunch of shysters!

                If I could give no stars I would. Bought a new laptop, microsoft office and 3 year care warranty from them. My order arrived just two days later. All seemed great. Then I opened the package containing my Microsoft Office  to find they had sent me the wrong version. Okay, I thought, simple to sort, I'll just get in touch to let them know and soon have my correct item. <br/>Numerous emails, phone calls to call centres based in Asia and a great deal of frustration later and I still have no resolution to my problem. <br/>I have been taken in circles; free phone customer service no. cuts off after 43 seconds without being answered. The chargeable customer service no. surprise, surprise is answered but the call handlers are in a foreign country, cannot be understood and couldn't understand me. They also had no comprehension of the products or services they were supposed to be helping with.<br/>The email customer service is no better, different person replying to me each time, when they bother to reply at all. They ask for the same information I have already provided and give me the same stock reply that my query will be dealt with as soon as possible. Which it is not!<br/>This company seems to deliberately make it as difficult as possible to get any sort of response from them. They are very quick to take your money though.<br/>If things are this bad just over an incorrect item being sent I really don't want to find out how bad things get if anything were to go wrong with the laptop itself. <br/>That is why I have now exercised my legal right to cancel my order and claim a full refund.<br/>I will NEVER deal with this company again.

                Very frustrating how bad this laptop is ( HP Laptop 15-da0xxx ) Do not buy it, you will regret it. This laptop is not worth ¬£700 I have had laptops that cost ¬£200 that are better than this, the battery life is shocking but more importantly it crashes all the time becomes very slow and also if you force shutdown by holding the power button you will have to wait over 30 mins for the thing to boot up, very disappointing product - I wish i spent a little extra and bought something else - I'm certainly never buying anything from this company again. I see you have terrible reviews here also and i know why, you deserve it.

                Review of HP2630 colour printer and scanner.<br/>As a retired professional computer maintenance technician and a qualified and experienced electronics engineer, I have worked in many areas of electronics and with lots of different I.T. equipment. I have seen many HP products over the years, but I am sad to report that over the past ten years or so, the quality of all HP products have steadily declined to the point where HP now produce sheer rubbish: their 2630 printer is a typical example.<br/>The driver S/W is totally overblown; the printer will not network over Ethernet; it frequently paper jams; user controls are confusing; ink is expensive; casework is cheap and 'plasticy' and mine recently poured out smoke! So it went into the bin; 2 months from new! Total waste of money.<br/>Whatever you do AVOID HP PRODUCTS AT ALL COSTS - utter rubbish. Rating starts? NONE.

                had the free 3 year warranty as part of the purchase price of an HP 6960 printer. 2 years on the print quality has deteriorated, wont print greens or blue. Red and Black are fine.<br/>Rang the helpline, he remote accessed my computer and said printers fine and its computer software issues. Wanted to charge me 39.99 to fix the 'Errors'. Refused and logged him off.<br/>When I went on other blogs they recommend a photocopy to see if its the printer hardware. Low and behold did a photocopy and its still rubbish. He never thought to ask me to do that just wanted my 39.99. Avoid HP warranty. Not worth a light. <br/>And for the record, signed up to their Instant Ink package so only ever used their cartridges.

                I was considering just giving HP the minimum 1 star....but the phone advisers at their Indian callcentre were so helpful &amp; polite during the 5 or 6 times I had to speak to them, that I've given (specifically) them an extra star. On that subject, I very much doubt that the Indian advisers' real names were ""David"" and ""Kevin"" like they said, but these were in fact pseudonyms given to them by HP in order to try and make UK customers think they were dealing with a Western callcentre/callcentre staff. I can't prove that this is the case, though I'm guessing it's highly probable. If so, it's a really sad state of affairs - patronising, belittling &amp; underhand from the Company, both towards their Indian callcentre staff, and the customers.<br/><br/>Anyway, re my laptop (¬£469), after 7 months the fan had to be replaced. Then after 10 months, the keyboard had to be replaced (due to a sticky spacebar). First time around, when my laptop was sent away via courier for repair, it was returned to me a week later untouched - baffling! But eventually the repairs were done well - the repair guy, that they sent out to fix my poorly laptop, was top-drawer. <br/><br/>After the 12 months (i.e. the end of the standard 1-year purchase warranty), I bought a new 3-year warranty, only to find out later that the original 1-year warranty was included in the 3-year term. This info was not stated on their website when I purchased the new warranty. In effect then it's a 2-year extended warranty, not a new 3-year one.<br/>Their sales guy on the phone also only quoted me a more expensive (engineer call-out) policy, without mentioning that there was also a cheaper (pick-up &amp; return) one available covering the same 3-year period. Fortunately, by sheer luck, I saw the cheaper one online &amp; was able to buy it.<br/><br/>There's no email address available to contact HP. Nor any details of how to complain on their website...which is quite arrogant IMHO. Having dealt with various departments, I get the impression that there's not much communication between them all, often resulting in duplication, confusion &amp; efficiency issues. Some of the emails I sent either just got forwarded to another team, or ignored.<br/><br/>In short then, whilst the performance of the spec of my HP laptop is very decent, I don't think my next laptop purchase will be another HP. At time of purchase, I went for the ""best value"" machine with the spec I wanted; next time I'll probably choose to spend a few more quid on my spec in order to try and get better reliability, transparency &amp; customer service from another maker.

                Very disappointed with the total lack of customer service. The Tech Support don't answer the phone and the 'virtual assistant' can't fix anything either. I have e-mailed head office and various other places, written to the UK address that distributes the cartridges all without any reply.<br/>I bought an ink catridge directly from HP which printed 4 pages and then ran out - so that was a waste of over ¬£20.00.<br/>This company's customer care is non-existant IMO

                Why someone should buy HP Products? ¬øWell known brand, reliability, trust, credibility..? NO, for sure.<br/>I bought an HP laptop because I thought I could trust the quality of the products of this company but the camera doesn't work since the beginning (I just need it to have video calls, nothing professional).  <br/>I contacted  HP customer service and the technical department changed the camera confirming it was not right. But when it came back it worked the same. I contacted CS several times, but they just said the (more or less) 600 Euros laptop I have bought was not good enough to have a good camera, and that one is the standard HP camera included.   <br/> As I could not believe the answer, I looked for the camera description on the HP website but there is no description, just says HP camera. What is not enough information to offer to a customer to know the product.<br/> I asked to do a formal complaint and the first answer  I received was that my complaint has not validity to be taken into consideration... Finally, after a long time speaking with the agent, he offered me to escalate the situation an call me back if It was accepted. As it is a really surprising method for a CS, and I insisted to have the right to have a proper answer, not just silence, at the end they did. The answer was to give me the information about the camera...Really? Now? Quite useless, don,t you think?  I just want  and I had paid for a camera working

                I purchased a HP Officejet Pro 6960 from Currys/PC World and with it HP were offering a free 3 year warranty if you supplied them with the serial number of the machine - which I duly did. They responded by saying they didn't recognise the serial number so couldn't offer a warranty.  After a great of toing and froing they asked that I supplied them with a photograph of the serial number?????? This I duly did and I've heard nothing from them since.  I've been a lifelong user of HP products - but not anymore.  Like a great many large concerns once they have your money then it's thank you and goodbye.  Extremely disappointed.

                I was considering just giving HP the minimum 1 star....but the phone advisers at their Indian callcentre were so helpful &amp; polite during the 5 or 6 times I had to speak to them, that I've given (specifically) them an extra star. On that subject, I very much doubt that the Indian advisers' real names were ""David"" and ""Kevin"" like they said, but these were in fact pseudonyms given to them by HP in order to try and make UK customers think they were dealing with a Western callcentre/callcentre staff. I can't prove that this is the case, though I'm guessing it's highly probable. If so, it's a really sad state of affairs - patronising, belittling &amp; underhand from the Company, both towards their Indian callcentre staff, and the customers.<br/><br/>Anyway, re my laptop (¬£469), after 7 months the fan had to be replaced. Then after 10 months, the keyboard had to be replaced (due to a sticky spacebar). First time around, when my laptop was sent away via courier for repair, it was returned to me a week later untouched - baffling! But eventually the repairs were done well - the repair guy, that they sent out to fix my poorly laptop, was top-drawer. <br/><br/>After the 12 months (i.e. the end of the standard 1-year purchase warranty), I bought a new 3-year warranty, only to find out later that the original 1-year warranty was included in the 3-year term. This info was not stated on their website when I purchased the new warranty. In effect then it's a 2-year extended warranty, not a new 3-year one.<br/>Their sales guy on the phone also only quoted me a more expensive (engineer call-out) policy, without mentioning that there was also a cheaper (pick-up &amp; return) one available covering the same 3-year period. Fortunately, by sheer luck, I saw the cheaper one online &amp; was able to buy it.<br/><br/>There's no email address available to contact HP. Nor any details of how to complain on their website...which is quite arrogant IMHO. Having dealt with various departments, I get the impression that there's not much communication between them all, often resulting in duplication, confusion &amp; efficiency issues. Some of the emails I sent either just got forwarded to another team, or ignored.<br/><br/>In short then, whilst the performance of the spec of my HP laptop is very decent, I don't think my next laptop purchase will be another HP. At time of purchase, I went for the ""best value"" machine with the spec I wanted; next time I'll probably choose to spend a few more quid on my spec in order to try and get better reliability, transparency &amp; customer service from another maker.

                Why someone should buy HP Products? ¬øWell known brand, reliability, trust, credibility..? NO, for sure.<br/>I bought an HP laptop because I thought I could trust the quality of the products of this company but the camera doesn't work since the beginning (I just need it to have video calls, nothing professional).  <br/>I contacted  HP customer service and the technical department changed the camera confirming it was not right. But when it came back it worked the same. I contacted CS several times, but they just said the (more or less) 600 Euros laptop I have bought was not good enough to have a good camera, and that one is the standard HP camera included.   <br/> As I could not believe the answer, I looked for the camera description on the HP website but there is no description, just says HP camera. What is not enough information to offer to a customer to know the product.<br/> I asked to do a formal complaint and the first answer  I received was that my complaint has not validity to be taken into consideration... Finally, after a long time speaking with the agent, he offered me to escalate the situation an call me back if It was accepted. As it is a really surprising method for a CS, and I insisted to have the right to have a proper answer, not just silence, at the end they did. The answer was to give me the information about the camera...Really? Now? Quite useless, don,t you think?  I just want  and I had paid for a camera working

They responded by saying they didn't recognise the serial number so couldn't offer a warranty.  After a great of toing and froing they asked that I supplied them with a photograph of the serial number?????? This I duly did and I've heard nothing from them since.  I've been a lifelong user of HP products - but not anymore.  Like a great many large concerns once they have your money then it's thank you and goodbye.  Extremely disappointed.

                I wish I read some of the earlier reviews! Very impressed with ordering on line and quick delivery. However,after a few days I discovered a fault with the microphone. Tech Support very helpful and after trying several options were unable to correct and advised a replacement was needed. Although their recommendations was passed to the appropriate department I also had to request a replacement using the email address sent to me. Despite 2 emails no response has been received. Feedback has also been responded to with low scores and still waiting. Might try a phone call or failing that request a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. <br/>January 2018 update. Eventually I was given permission to return the faulty machine but it took two weeks for it to be collected. Despite reserving a replacement for me, I was subsequently advised the model was out of stock. I had to wait about 2 weeks for the refund during which I ordered another model. I received it just before Christmas and today 4 January 2019 I had an error message that ""it is plugged in and not charging"" Needless to say it is evening time and the phone support is not available until Monday morning.  Since writing this yesterday, I have discovered that this is a Microsoft Windows error that affects other computers including Dell and Lenovo. To readers of my comments (now deleted) and to Hewlett Packard I now apologise for my comments. I still intend to contact HP asap to see if it can be remedied.

                I recently purchased 2 expensive Elite Book Laptops from Hewlett Packard.<br/>They have both had to be returned under warrenty for repairs. The first one returned was a hardware fault with the ethernet port. This was repaired and returned, The hard drive had been reset to factory but didnt cause to much of a problem as nothing was loaded on to the PC as it was new. The second laptop developed a RAM issue and had to be returned for new RAM. Whilst the Laptop was in for repair I recieved constant emails that requests were being made to change my Apple and Amazon acount passwords. When I contacted Apple and Amazon they asked if anyone had access to my email accounts and suggested i changed all passwords. Which i did. As i could not start the Laptop due to the fault i had to give HP the Laptop Username and password, so the only people who had access to my email accounts were HP. coincidence? I contacted HP and asked to speak to customer services and i am still waiting for a reply! When the laptop was returned to me i found the Hard drive had be wiped and Windows 10 re installed without the recovery drive D so not even back to factory, for no reason. I opened an online complaint as i wanted explinations, that was over a week ago still no one has contacted me. You can judge a companys performance when things go wrong, and HP have been genuinely awful. I am self employed and rely on reliable PC, and this incident cost me several days work to get the laptopback to a useable one.

                I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didn‚Äôt seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue. <br/><br/>It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time. <br/><br/>I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break. They asked me if I had the laptop in front of me and I said no, explaining that I work during the hours the helpline is open and that I don‚Äôt want to bring the laptop to work on a busy train. The technician understood this and gave me some instructions to update the BIOS and perform a system restore when I got home - I did this but it did not resolve my issues. I emailed the technician to tell them it hadn‚Äôt worked. In response they tried to ring me a couple of times but I was in work and couldn‚Äôt answer and was unable to ring them back after work because the helpline closes at 6pm. They did eventually email instead and asked for a recording of the whirring noise that the laptop was making so that they could try and assess the problem. I was unable to email back with the recording the following day but I did reply the next day. In response to this email, I received an email back stating that my case had been closed. <br/><br/>I contacted HP and had to start the process all over again. This time I tried to resolve the problem over their live chat option, but the technician told me that they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me without me having the laptop in front of me. So the next day, I reluctantly took my laptop into work on a busy train into a busy town. On my lunch break I contacted HP again and they remote accessed my laptop and began work on it. As I was using poor WiFi in a coffee shop and had limited time on my break, it was not sufficient time for the work to be completed and the work that was done (updating drivers and deleting temporary folders) still did not resolve the issues. On my way home from work, my bag was knocked off my shoulder at the train station and hit the floor. When I got home, I found that my laptop - that was in a protective case, was badly damaged.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that this was accidental damage and not covered under the product‚Äôs warranty but due to the ineffective helpline and inconvenient operating hours they have, I had no choice but to take my laptop into an environment where it was at risk of getting damaged.<br/><br/>When contacting HP again the technician told me I couldn‚Äôt talk to a complaints team as my complaint was not valid. The whole customer service experience was appalling and made it very difficult to get issues resolved on a product and ultimately contributed to the subsequent damaged caused. I was told it would cost at least ¬£300 to fix - the laptop cost ¬£480.<br/><br/>I had told the technician, on the original call to them, that the laptop clearly had a hardware issue, as the noise it was making was very loud. I later found out that the technician‚Äôs original call notes had said that he believed, from what I had told him, that it was a hardware issue. So surely the laptop should have been arranged to be collected and repaired on the first day I made contact? They however, seemed to do everything they could to avoid this. <br/><br/>In summary: the HP product I bought had multiple issues very soon after buying it, their helpline is ineffective and no use if you work Monday to Friday, and you can‚Äôt make a complaint unless THEY decide it‚Äôs valid. Avoid HP products.

After 3 months it developed a problem with a really noisy fan.  I returned it to John Lewis at my own expense and they in turn sent it to HP for repair.  HP advised  that I had damaged the machine and the warranty was void as a result. How is it possible through very light and normal use - opening and closing the lid and turning it on - to damage a machine. I did not damage the laptop. However, neither John Lewis or HP will repair it without charging me. Now I am stuck with a three month old defective laptop - never buy from HP (or John Lewis), They do not deserve consumer trust or custom.

I was told I would have to pay ¬£300 for a repair even though they don't know what the issue is and I have only owned it for a short period. <br/><br/>When I tried to ask if their laptops were only designed to last one year they just kept repeating the same sentence to me that as it was out of warranty and  I would have to pay ¬£300 to get the laptop fixed. Very rudely when I said I could purchase a brand new one for that amount of money replied 'we could give you a good deal on a new one'.<br/><br/>I then requested to raise a complaint, but was advised I wasn't allowed as I didn't have a valid complaint. I was not allowed to raise a complaint.<br/><br/>When I escalated this and after much argument they provided me with a customer relations email which I was to respond to with my complaint. When I responded with my complaint it bounced back saying the complaint had been closed.<br/><br/>I then called the general number to follow up my email and they advised that the customer services team had called me and told me they had closed my complaint- which they hadn't. Upon investigation they admitted they hadn't called but had closed my complaint as it was 'invalid'.<br/><br/>I asked if the Customer Relations department could call me themselves but was advised they would try to get them to call me but they 'probably wouldn't' and also refused to put their response in writing. <br/><br/>I found it very rude that they didn't advise me via email/ phone or attempt to speak to me in any way before closing the complaint. I have had no response since and the outcome of the complaint was still pay ¬£300 or the laptop will remain broken. <br/><br/>I am truly astounded and disgusted in the service provided by HP. I am a Buyer for a large company and therefore am aware of both the role of Consumer Relations team and their importance as well as the Sale of Goods Act/ Consumer Rights Act which states items must be fit for purpose and of an acceptable quality- my laptop being neither of these things. <br/><br/>I have never owned a laptop that has lasted just over one year and am truly astounded that HP were so rude and unwilling to look in to this for both myself and potential other customers which could be affected.<br/><br/> I will not be recommending HP to anyone else and looking at other reviews many people also feel the same. <br/><br/>In desperate need for improvements in customer service and internal processes.

                Unfortunately can‚Äôt give zero stars.<br/><br/>Paid ¬£270 to get the screen fixed on my HP Spectre. Told I would have priority due to the model.<br/><br/>After six weeks of failed promises and missed deadlines I asked for my laptop back still broke and there complaints procedure. Got told by a very rude customer services that if I complained it would take me weeks to get my laptop back so don‚Äôt bother.<br/><br/>When my laptop was finally returned still broke, the original crack in the screen had increased ten fold, the outside case was cover in scratches and all content along with boot drive had been wiped.

                Useless laptop, useless support, - new laptop (¬£650.00) completely crashes after 42 days - 12 days after you can return for full refund. Sent away for repair - really !!!! - crashed 4 more times - support only available Monday - Friday so ok if you don't work - support 'repairs' again over the phone but as it is now 1 year old if it goes again, I have to pay for their service OR take out an extended warranty - more money to waste.  Do not waste your money on these products as they are really not interested

                I wish I read some of the earlier reviews! Very impressed with ordering on line and quick delivery. However,after a few days I discovered a fault with the microphone. Tech Support very helpful and after trying several options were unable to correct and advised a replacement was needed. Although their recommendations was passed to the appropriate department I also had to request a replacement using the email address sent to me. Despite 2 emails no response has been received. Feedback has also been responded to with low scores and still waiting. Might try a phone call or failing that request a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. <br/>January 2018 update. Eventually I was given permission to return the faulty machine but it took two weeks for it to be collected. Despite reserving a replacement for me, I was subsequently advised the model was out of stock. I had to wait about 2 weeks for the refund during which I ordered another model. I received it just before Christmas and today 4 January 2019 I had an error message that ""it is plugged in and not charging"" Needless to say it is evening time and the phone support is not available until Monday morning.  Since writing this yesterday, I have discovered that this is a Microsoft Windows error that affects other computers including Dell and Lenovo. To readers of my comments (now deleted) and to Hewlett Packard I now apologise for my comments. I still intend to contact HP asap to see if it can be remedied. I thought I should delete my critical comments regarding the new computer as soon as possible. I have also increased the * rating.

                My wife puchased a HP Envy 6230 printer from John Lewis, this printer was offered with a ¬£30 cashback, my wife As required sent copies of the receipt together with the instant ink confirmation email. HP responded with claim rejected,and again my wife was repeatedly requested to send proof of purchase, this she did on at least two more occasions, HP did NOT RESPOND, Upon checking progress of the claim, it showed CLAIM REJECTED. Upon enquiring elsewhere i find that HP reject the vast majority of claims in respect of cashback.<br/>THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CON, i now propose to confirm the aforementioned to John Lewis as I suspect that they will not wish to<br/>be associated with  such a company ,who make false claims to sell their products

                I recently purchased 2 expensive Elite Book Laptops from Hewlett Packard.<br/>They have both had to be returned under warrenty for repairs. The first one returned was a hardware fault with the ethernet port. This was repaired and returned, The hard drive had been reset to factory but didnt cause to much of a problem as nothing was loaded on to the PC as it was new. The second laptop developed a RAM issue and had to be returned for new RAM. Whilst the Laptop was in for repair I recieved constant emails that requests were being made to change my Apple and Amazon acount passwords. When I contacted Apple and Amazon they asked if anyone had access to my email accounts and suggested i changed all passwords. Which i did. As i could not start the Laptop due to the fault i had to give HP the Laptop Username and password, so the only people who had access to my email accounts were HP. coincidence? I contacted HP and asked to speak to customer services and i am still waiting for a reply! When the laptop was returned to me i found the Hard drive had be wiped and Windows 10 re installed without the recovery drive D so not even back to factory, for no reason. I opened an online complaint as i wanted explinations, that was over a week ago still no one has contacted me. You can judge a companys performance when things go wrong, and HP have been genuinely awful. I am self employed and rely on reliable PC, and this incident cost me several days work to get the laptopback to a useable one.

                I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didn‚Äôt seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue. <br/><br/>It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time. <br/><br/>I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break. They asked me if I had the laptop in front of me and I said no, explaining that I work during the hours the helpline is open and that I don‚Äôt want to bring the laptop to work on a busy train. The technician understood this and gave me some instructions to update the BIOS and perform a system restore when I got home - I did this but it did not resolve my issues. I emailed the technician to tell them it hadn‚Äôt worked. In response they tried to ring me a couple of times but I was in work and couldn‚Äôt answer and was unable to ring them back after work because the helpline closes at 6pm. They did eventually email instead and asked for a recording of the whirring noise that the laptop was making so that they could try and assess the problem. I was unable to email back with the recording the following day but I did reply the next day. In response to this email, I received an email back stating that my case had been closed. <br/><br/>I contacted HP and had to start the process all over again. This time I tried to resolve the problem over their live chat option, but the technician told me that they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me without me having the laptop in front of me. So the next day, I reluctantly took my laptop into work on a busy train into a busy town. On my lunch break I contacted HP again and they remote accessed my laptop and began work on it. As I was using poor WiFi in a coffee shop and had limited time on my break, it was not sufficient time for the work to be completed and the work that was done (updating drivers and deleting temporary folders) still did not resolve the issues. On my way home from work, my bag was knocked off my shoulder at the train station and hit the floor. When I got home, I found that my laptop - that was in a protective case, was badly damaged.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that this was accidental damage and not covered under the product‚Äôs warranty but due to the ineffective helpline and inconvenient operating hours they have, I had no choice but to take my laptop into an environment where it was at risk of getting damaged.<br/><br/>When contacting HP again the technician told me I couldn‚Äôt talk to a complaints team as my complaint was not valid. The whole customer service experience was appalling and made it very difficult to get issues resolved on a product and ultimately contributed to the subsequent damaged caused. I was told it would cost at least ¬£300 to fix - the laptop cost ¬£480.<br/><br/>I had told the technician, on the original call to them, that the laptop clearly had a hardware issue, as the noise it was making was very loud. I later found out that the technician‚Äôs original call notes had said that he believed, from what I had told him, that it was a hardware issue. So surely the laptop should have been arranged to be collected and repaired on the first day I made contact? They however, seemed to do everything they could to avoid this. <br/><br/>In summary: the HP product I bought had multiple issues very soon after buying it, their helpline is ineffective and no use if you work Monday to Friday, and you can‚Äôt make a complaint unless THEY decide it‚Äôs valid. Avoid HP products.

                They dont like to pick up the phone, thats for sure. 15 minutes so far.Thankyou for your patience message. Whats that mean? That means customer service isn't valued as important to them as it is to customers. <br/>Also the claimback cashback is so convoluted and difficult it makes you wonder if this is done on purpose.<br/>If you cannot honour it without the jumping through hoops HP then just dont advertise it, as it really undermines your integrity.You do know there are other company's?

                HP just don't care. I bought HP Pavilion X360 15-br013na Laptop, Intel Pentium, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 15.6‚Äù from John Lewis.  After 3 months it developed a problem with a really noisy fan.  I returned it to John Lewis at my own expense and they in turn sent it to HP for repair.  HP advised  that I had damaged the machine and the warranty was void as a result. How is it possible through very light and normal use - opening and closing the lid and turning it on - to damage a machine. I did not damage the laptop. However, neither John Lewis or HP will repair it without charging me. Now I am stuck with a three month old defective laptop - never buy from HP (or John Lewis), They do not deserve consumer trust or custom.

                Ordered an i5 laptop, confirmed by HP on 17 Apr, at 15:24. A minute later, I was asked to verify my email address. HP website wouldn't accept it. Tried all evening and next morning but no joy. ""Best cancel order"" me thought but that requires logging in to an account; the creation of which may be achieved only after email verification.<br/><br/>Eventually, 18+ hours after placing my order, I was able to verify my email address. Soon afterwards, I received an email to inform me that the order had been shipped. Effectively, by delaying email verification, HP denied me my right to cancel the order before it was shipped. NOT IMPRESSED, so the package will be returned, on principle.<br/><br/>19 Apr. Package arrived during the correct, 1 hr ""window"" and the returns procedure has been completed, online. Hoping for collection on 23 Apr.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Laptop collected, unopened, and full refund received; 10 days after payment. The issue was purely the delay in verifying my email.

                Terrible service from HP. I have a laptop that i purchased an extended warranty directly from their website. Had an issue with my keyboard whilst in warranty which they decided they didn't want to look at and sent me a replacement keyboard. This worked for a while but now has also become faulty and now the manager of technical support Roger Hawk informs me he would like to 'offer' me a paid repair as my warranty ran out a few weeks ago. So they decided to apply a quick, cheap fix whilst in warranty and now that the issue has returned want to charge me to fix the same issue again with no guarantee this fix will last.<br/><br/>Avoid their products as they won't last for long and will force you to keep paying them for short term fixes.

                If only I had read the Trustpilot reviews before purchasing from Hewlett Packard, I would have ran for the hills, as the customer service is absolutely deplorable. <br/><br/>My desktop pc arrived on the Friday and was unboxed in the evening. We discovered it was badly damaged, but unfortunately their phone lines were closed for the day and no one works at the weekend. <br/><br/>On Monday, after a long wait to be connected to an advisor. I managed to get the ball rolling in order to get an uplift, which took about a week. As I'm typing this review, I've been on with customer services again, trying to ascertain as to when I'll receive a refund. The young gentleman I spoke to sounded very peed off and demoralised, he's perhaps the figurehead for a company that's in despair. <br/><br/>It's no surprise that Hewlett Packard is in a bad way globally, especially when they can't get their customer service right, as I for one shall not be back. <br/><br/>The item I bought was ¬£950. For a purchase in that price region, I honestly expected much better. Geez, I didn't even get a keyboard and mouse with it. <br/><br/>Overall, take my advice on board and avoid Hewlett Packard.

You have eyes to look at the better spec pc's and deduce, that perhaps more expensive models are better equipped or finished overall. <br/><br/>It's exactly the same in any other industry, be it the car industry, or instrument industry, furniture industry, or whatever industry, quality and higher prices are going together, may it sink in.<br/><br/>So why am I a satisfied customer?<br/><br/>I got an expensive HP for a bargain, and I saved 30% of the total price.<br/><br/>And it's excellent. But I've used my friends slow slow slow less expensive 300¬£ HP and it's just unbearably bad, for me, but if that is your budget, you have to adjust to that.<br/><br/>**I've called HP customer service before, and they helped me with my friends HP, and the problem didn't occur again**

                Customer service is so bad I thought the company was based in the US.  Seriously, I really did!  Durr!<br/><br/>Had problems with the 2  HP printers I bought, the one in the spare room has never worked,(3055A) contacted HP for help numerous  times, they did try and help!  Didn't offer a refund but were prepared to sell me another.  Ended up buying a new printer from them - i was desperate!  Living in a very rural area I can't pop into a neighbour let alone a store!  Have to do all my own copies when needed!<br/><br/>Wouldn't recommend HP unless your a bright young thing and can go it alone.  I'm 73 and find it a struggle!<br/><br/>I have been happy with the HP lap top I have, got a lot of click here to get help, on it!  Not like being able to speak to someone.

                Just bought a laptop from HP, they have taken the money from my account and they've sent me the confirmation email.  All good. Then an hour later, I received another email that my order was cancelled for no apparent reason. I have called the customer service twice and apparently they cannot help me out, because they cannot see my order in the system even though the money is missing from my account. Too bad because I really wanted that laptop, but  this has been a very disappointing experience. Hope I will get my money back soon, so I can look for a new laptop elsewhere. Also want to point out that one of the customer service agents told me ""call us back after 5:30 PM"" which is actually when the lines are closing for the day. Great customer service Hewlett-Packard!!

                I bought the HP wireless printer about 18 months ago.  Sometimes I used HP cartridges but sometimes alternatives like Asda.  I came back from holiday to find that my printer (with Asda cartridge) would no longer work. To my surprise I discovered that HP have a facility to disable my printer if alternative cartridges are inserted and to my horror they had actually used this facility.  Talk about ""Big Brother is watching you"".  The outcome of this is that I will never buy another HP product and I'm replacing my printer immediately.   This type of action by any Company is totally unacceptable when customers have paid good money for a product.

                My HP laptop is a few months old.  When the keyboard malfunctioned recently my regular tech support company told me it would take 3 or 4 weeks to source a new one and 10 mins to fit it. Reluctantly I contacted HP  who said they needed the whole laptop back and would arrange pick up from a courier. Anyone who has ever dealt with dpd will know they are a disaster - communication skills of a baboon.  It took dpd 3 days to contact<br/>me and I had to go to the depot twice to sort out pick up.  That was 13 days ago and in the last 3 days I have received 3 contradictory messages from HP about the status of my laptop.  I phoned three times but didn't get confirmation of anything really - but they are really good at reading screens and telling you what you have already told them. Very pleasant to deal with but they couldn't understand some of what I was saying and I had to repeat and correct things quite a lot. I got home yesterday and found a dpd 'sorry i missed you' note on the mat.  This despite the fact I have their app on my iPhone telling me no delivery was due.  I have to go back up to the depot now and goodness knows what's next ... all for 10 mins to replace a flipping keyboard. There must be an easier way to do things.

                Really excited to get a new PC and recommended by a nephew who works for HP.  Within one week the product had frozen and would not work at all.  I contacted HP and was only able to talk to a rep in India - no disrespect to them, but this was absolutely useless.  I explained the situation; was told that I would have to return the brand new product to them (which would take 14 days to set up) and that there was no guarantee that they would deal with the problem.  I use this product for my small business and was SO disappointed.  I have since had an email back to say that they would issue a returns authorisaton form (DOA) - does this mean 'Dead On Arrival'?!! - which 'would entitle me to an exchange at your point of sale'.  Fortunately I have a really good technician who had set up my system for me and he suggested leaving the notebook on the docking station for 24 hours.  Miraculously this worked and my notebook came back to life again.  It took HP Customer Relations Specialist 11 days to respond with a reply to my problem - by which time I needed to do all sorts of business operations e.g. VAT return, CIS return, pickup business emails etc.<br/>What a shambles.  SO disappointed with after sales and the fact that I was unable to talk to someone in UK.  I bought UK product and would expect to be at least able to talk to someone about it.

                After my grandparents generously decided to give me a printer for university I was over the moon as I could not afford one myself. They even bought me the best one on the market - the HP officejet Pro 6830. I don't think any money has been spent any worse than on this particular printer. Not only would it never connect to my internet but the costumer service was horrendous too and basically blamed my internet provider for the issues. My internet providers ended up trying to guide me in how the printer works (as the fault was not on their side) but with no luck. So I went out and spent money on a wire so I could connect it my Macbook directly to my computer but it still does not work. <br/>I would never ever ever recommend anyone to ever buy a HP printer. And if they might consider it I will do my very best to warn them as they might end up spending over 1,5hrs trying to sort out the bloody printer just to print a single page. Every single time you need to print.

                I bought a HP Laptop about 3 years ago, and the Windows 10 updates have caused me massive issues. In their wisdom, HP have decided not to provide device updates for windows 10 for anyone who has purchased their products prior to Aug 2013.  Absolute crap, and no doubt a ploy to get people to buy their products.  I can't afford a new laptop so I attempted to recover 8.1 with the disks that came with the Laptop instead.  Disks do not work, which I didn't realise, and would not have realised before trying to use them to recover.  I have a license which extends to whenever Windows 8.1 goes on, - which is years.  Can't get hold of anyone at HP and when I have sent them an e-mail, I have received a standard response saying my 1 year warranty has expired.  Well there is a law called 'sale of goods act 1979' that applies to my purchase up until 5 years afterwards.  So I'm going down that road now.  <br/>We have allowed a culture with technology to evolve whereby we just accept things as they are.  Poor CS, poor products and shafted into getting new products to line these people's already full to the brim pockets. Absolute crap.

                In November 2015 I purchased a new laptop off the line at HP, the 15-ak011na. I got BSoDs from nearly day one, random input from the keyboard and mouse, and just poor quality functioning from the outset - it was noisy, it would freeze all the time, and just generally didn't function as well as it should given that it's got some pretty powerful hardware in it.<br/><br/>After a lot of hassle with the tech support team, the laptop was taken away for repair, which I was told was to be completed within 10 days. However, a month later and the team had had my laptop for as long as I had owned it myself, with no sign of it actually coming back for another few weeks. Desperately needing it for University, I took some extra measures which eventually got me a new laptop, compensated by a better model for my hassle. This is great, and the HP store guys are really friendly and lovely, but the tech are a nightmare, on top of the outright poor build of at least this line of laptops.<br/><br/>My replacement was a 15 ak116na, a more powerful laptop of the same line. However, very quickly I was faced with the same problems. Similar BSoDs, random input from the mouse and keyboard, and slightly disturbing noises from the laptop got me to call tech again. They ran a 'scan' (one which I knew myself would do literally nothing to actually fix the laptop), which they assured me would work, but otherwise I'd have to reinstall the OS (which to me seems ridiculous when I order a pre-built laptop! It should come working!). Evidently, the fix didn't work, I did some of my own tests, couldn't find anything, and then called up again when I got very frequent BSoDs. The man on the phone told me we'd have to reinstall the OS, and when we went to do it, the recovery files and executions which should have allowed it were missing. I was told I'd be shipped the files and have to do it later.<br/><br/>This is just getting ridiculous. I shouldn't have to be sent two laptops that aren't working and have to make them functional myself. Considering everything that happened the last time, it would have been nice to have had a little bit of consideration from the team (who have all been told about the situation every time I've called). Still no fix and it's starting to take a toll on my grades. Sick of this! I wouldn't buy again.

                Ok, first of all, I have to have empathy for people with poor reviews.  I understand companies like HP are generally useless as customer service.  In fact getting ahold of them is a nightmere, they need to have clearer contacts.<br/><br/>I have a very nice printer, ¬£500ish, that I purchased from Staples.  After very little use and 18 months its gave me an error message. I took it to staples who told me it was cheaper to buy a new one even though this one was basically brand new.  I contacted HP and explained the situation, not really expecting much of a response.  <br/><br/>I was called by a person in their contact centre who said they would replace the machine for me with a refurbished machine.  When it arrived it was as good as brand new, all wrapped up etc... and they included ¬£200 worth of full ink.  <br/><br/>If more larger companies started to understand that when they treat customers like this we will purchase from them again, I certainly will.<br/><br/>In this case I have to give a big thumbs up to HP and their customer service!<br/><br/>Paul Rhodes <br/>Seven Institute

                It's a sad old world we live in now. The more I choose to contract with these corporations, the more I lose the will to live.<br/><br/>Recently purchased an HP Envy laptop on Amazon, apparently new. Upon arrival, item certainly appeared to be brand new with box, packaging and usual screen protectors etc in place. Also purchased, independent of HP, an m-SATA SSD drive. This installed and was recognised fine by the laptop. I then did a fresh install of Windows 10, onto the SSD, re-using the same license from Windows 8.1 that came with the laptop, pre-installed on the internal 1TB spindle hard drive. Before installing Windows 10, I also performed essential BIOS updates, using and as recommended by the main HP website.<br/><br/>All was good until the laptop started reporting a smart fault with the hard drive that was in it. I took note of the smart ID as presented to me on the screen, and performed necessary BIOS checks on the drive as it recommended. This did not rectify the issue. In the end, I physically removed the drive as it was causing an error to appear upon every boot and was also preventing (for what ever reason) the laptop from booting from the SSD I had now installed, thus preventing the continued setup of Windows 10.<br/><br/>Laptop now runs fine with the original spindle hard disk removed (which is, I suppose, a bonus because it is now quieter and means battery lasts longer). So I contacted HP support to arrange replacement of this drive. I should also say that upon removing the drive, it didn't look new and had some strange scuff marks on the circular spindle drive cover on the underside. After a whole polava with HP support, they finally agreed to accept return of the drive. Or so I thought (I knew this was too good to be true).<br/><br/>Hard drive was collected. 7 days later, they returned the exact same drive back to me. When I questioned why, they said they needed the entire laptop back, even though it is working fine now with the SSD installed, even though I clearly provided them a smart ID failure code for the hard drive, as presented to me by the laptop itself.<br/><br/>I've now written this issue off. There are more important things in life than to be dealing with c**p like this, and as a woman said in a restaurant once in a video that went viral, HP need to get this s**t right the first time, or not at all. You get it right the first time, that's what customer service is about. But so many of these corporations are in it for nothing more than the money and lining their pockets with profits.<br/><br/>Not a good experience, and unlikely to purchase another HP product again. All they had to do was test the drive, like any other normal company would do, but they didn't. They wanted the entire laptop back. No tolerance for this s**t any more I'm afraid HP. Get a grip, fast. Over and out.

                We have bought many PCs, laptops and printers over the last 20 years and have spent thousands of pounds with Hewlett Packard either directly or through a third party.  Obviously we have been happy in the past because we have purchased so many products. We bought a replacement printer in January (after HP sales recommendation). This gave us problems and we replaced it (again after HP recommendation). But although customer services had promised to refund us, once I had bought the replacement I could not get any response from them. HP just don't bother to call back or email back. I have asked for my emails to be passed to the CEO but still no response. I can see from the other comments that HP customer service is not what it was and they don't seem to care about their reputation.  I have spoken to staff representing HP who have been rude and brusque. We are due to buy 2 PCs and I must admit this has definitely put us off. Do HP not realise that good customer service ensures more sales in the long run?

This year I have just bought a new laptop and a new printer, both separate days, both had cashback offers advertised at the point of sale in john Lewis.<br/><br/>Having tried to claim the cashback its obvious it just a scam and they will try all options not to pay, the first one I have been told it was bought at the wrong time!! the second one by the time they looked at the request the claim was in the wrong time window.<br/><br/>will not use again and this is not the sort of scam you would expect from a large well known company.<br/><br/>Avoid them or accept the higher price.

                Finding myself needing a new printer in February 2015 I looked at a number of makes and models, amongst which I liked most a Hewlett Packard one but it was a bit over my budget. However, I found mention of a ¬£40 Cashback offer if I bought direct from HP, although there was conflicting information online as to when the offer ended. Some pages said 31 January, some said 30 April.<br/><br/>At this point the complexities of dealing with HP should have warned me off them. If you look for information on their web pages you find yourself going round and round in circles, likewise if you try to find out how to contact them. Eventually I found a suitable phone number whose operative confirmed the offer had been extended to 30 April, and I was given another number to call for re-confirmation. <br/><br/>I ordered the HP printer as it was now more affordable to me. Delivery was prompt, and I heeded the advice to register it, doing this the following day. No invoice was received, I had to email HP to ask for one, and there was no further information about the Cashback, but I felt sure I would be contacted. When this did not happen, I uneasily searched again for information online, where I found nothing concrete, just vague suggestions that one had up to 60 days to claim. <br/><br/>Eventually I started sending emails of enquiry to HP, the replies to these always directed me to different departments until one day I was given the phone number for printer cashback, where a man told me I should have registered for the Cashback. The one I had completed was just to register the product, it seems. This was news to me, but there was little response to my remark that my psychic powers must have deserted me. (I must add here that I have not spoken to anyone on a HP phone number whose first language was English.)<br/><br/>Following his advice, I emailed full details which,  I was told, would be presented to the head of department for consideration. By return of email 5 days later, I was informed there were ""rules and regulations to the promotion"" as detailed in an attached 5-page pdf of T&amp;Cs, and I had not met the terms of contract as I was now outside the registration period. My further email of protest has not been replied to, they appear to have chosen to ignore it.<br/><br/>So don't be taken in by any such offer, take the higher price as being what the goods will cost you, for it is my opinion that these crooks HP intentionally set out to make it as difficult as possible for you to get any Cashback.

                I bought an HP laptop from Currys/PC World in Late November 2015 but it failed with a hard drive error.  I took the laptop back to Currys/PC World and they tried to start it and stated it was a hard drive issue.  They told me it would take about a week to fix.  I received a call from an engineer saying the laptop would not be repaired under the warranty as it had water damage and it would. Out me ¬£118.00 to repair, (I paid ¬£430 for the laptop), I refuted this as there was absolutely no way any kind of liquid came into contact with this laptop but paid as the laptop was bought for my daughter for her GCSE's and she needed it for this reason.  The repair report stated faulty hard drive, (which was returned back to me).  There is no way I can prove liquid wasn't spilled on this laptop I just know it wasn't and feel like I have been scammed because HP didn't want to repair this laptop under the warranty.  I will not touch this company again with a bargepole or Curry's/PC World for that matter.  I feel I have been treated abysmally, absolutely disgusting Customer Service from both companies as they just didn't want to listen to my concerns.  Buyers beware!

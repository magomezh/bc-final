                IBM is the best cloud managing company currently available in the market. they have also a good exposure to machine learning/AI tools. by using IBM tools we can completely automate our web services. they also provides a satisfactory customer care service.

                I would give NEGATIVE stars if I could! They were not only rude on the phone saying ""just google what you are asking, its pretty simple"" after I was asking advice if there was anything I could do to extend a trial, so I am able to finish school (due to the quarantine). They told me unless I am either a business or buying the program they can't do anything for me. I asked to be transferred to a manager, so I could ask if there was anything the company can do even if it meant sponsoring me to a paid version for one month or even getting a discount, so I could afford this extremely expensive SPSS, and I got even ruder remarks and when I confronted the woman for being rude all I am asking for is help she hung up on me. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!! This experience left me in tears after the phone call. They have absolutely terrible customer service and don't care about you unless you even with all that is happening in the world right now. It's upsetting to see a business run this way.

                I tried to call their Danish customer service to resign an agreement. I got a UK customer service department and was then transfered to a Finish customer service department where I was on hold for 30 minuttes.  Outrageous horrible service for a company like IBM

                It would be hard to find a firm with worse customer service than IBM. Opaque, confusing, hard to communicate and time wasting. Truly a day spent with IBM customer service would make anyone suicidal. I can see why the stock performance is so disappointing

                These are the guys who own softlayer, and ran it to the ground. The support is crap. You're also charged a ton for things you can get cheaper elsewhere. Extortion mucrg

                Absolutely has the worst customer service. If there was an option to give zero stars, I would. I spoke to them about cancelling my subscription and not being charged before the month started. They were not willing to help which is understandable due to the policy agreement, but what is not okay is that they later double charged me for the service that I'm not even using

                My credit card was charged twice on 13th and 14th November for SPSS monthly subscription and I called 132 426  customer service and was transferred to the wrong department twice (once to business that don’t deal with invoices and another time to spss grad pack that doesn’t deal with SPSS subscriptions. I wrote an email to IBM invoice department about the matter. I later call 1800 629 135 for and was hung up on. I called 9354 4000 and was also hung up on. This is appaling service

                IBM was the best business partner I ever had. I used IBM software to connect  my employees who worked from remote locations to my Architectural firms servers and to one another, We shared our work products and progress documentation with our clients their legal advisors, regulators having jurisdiction over the work and the contractors performing the construction throughout often fast tracked planning design and construction of public convention facilities .    We were a small firm, doing big projects. We got fortune 50 tools and service from IBM.  From the early days of OS2 to 2015 when I retired, IBM made my Architectural firms business plan possible and successful.  There is nobody better than IBM.

                CRAP We where an IBM user for years. Their Technical Services are pathetic. Used their GTS services to fix a DDOS issue and made worse.

                IBM Company Digital River advertised on Facebook 14 DAY FREE TRIAL and stole £64.99 immediately from my bank account. I warm everybody against  ''FREE TRIALS'' It is a corporate lie and I will sue them for the damage caused by their corporate greed and arrogance. I have to wait till 11th March for Paypal to possible give me my money back. If not I will go to Guardian media and to My MP and Sue IBM for £10000000

                Shocking Experience : While logging an incident with the Wireless Device of my Laptop, their (called Victoria) picked up the phone on 28/11/18 around 16:30. The 1st thing that she did was to ask me to update the Driver. But I knew it was a Hardware Problem as my colleagues with the same Driver had no issues. Moreover, the laptop is new and came with the latest Driver available at the time of shipping. So I enquired if there were any known issues with that driver which the next released Driver solved. But she wouldn't listen and threatened to Disconnect me and Actually disconnected me deliberately. As it turned out a month later, the issue was not with the Driver, but she wouldn't listen to the Problem at all and Disconnected the Call. Please train your Customer Support Team to Talk Professionally and Courteously and Not to Threaten to Disconnect and Actually Disconnect the Customer. In fact, this particular Call is an ideal training material for “What Not To Do with a Customer”.

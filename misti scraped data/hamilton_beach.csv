Hamilton Beach,Office Supplies,1 star: Bad,"My experience with customer service was abominable.  Emails went back and forth for 10 days and I got the same automatic responses.  Obviously no one was actually reading my emails.  I WILL NEVER BUY A HAMILTON BEACH PRODUCT AGAIN AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME! GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD NEED CUSTOMER SERVICE—GOOD LUCK  !

                What a complete piece of dog sh!t.  It's criminal to put products on the market that are dangerous....and charge people for them.  For Christ sake, spend the extra money for a product that has been designed and engineered to make your life (and your food prep) easier.  Their Goddamn toasters have a lip on them that doesn't allow toast (frozen waffle/ english muffins') to pop up when they are done toasting.  I finally burned the sh!t out of my thumb trying to get my toast out of the mother phucking thing this morning (I've been flirting with disaster every time I use this  plastic , ridiculously engineered piece of monkey sh!t).  Phuuck Hamilton Beach and their design team.  Vote with your dollar and do not support their products'!!!  People I'd rather deal with than Hamilton Beach:  Adolph Hitler, Lucifer, Osama Bin Laden, Xi Jinping, The U.S. Government.

                I bought a few Hamilton Beach microwaves and 2 of them started sparking inside when I turned on, after a few months. When I called Hamilton Beach Customer service, after 1 hour I was able to talk to a human who gave a reference number for refund / replacement and asked me to take these items to a Walmart Store. Walmart Store refused to accept the return and asked me contact Walmart.com! When I reached out to Walmart.com rep, she flatly refused to accept the return as it was purchased 3 months ago and refused to process the refund even though I gave her the reference number which I received from Hamilton Beach. After wasting so much time, Walmart.com gave a promo coupon of $25 for a microwave that cost $49.99 provided I spend at least $45 through Walmart.com again!. So, do not buy from Walmart.com and if you do and if you try to return to Walmart Store, good luck trying to get a refund or replacement even though the manufacturer may give a ref number for refund/replacement! No Hamilton Beach Products please and no walmart.com again!  The good thing is that I had SquareTrade extended warranty taken for one item. They came to my rescue and agreed to provide a full refund for this item as they understood my frustration. Thanks SquareTrade, you are the savior!

                As a brand Hamilton Beach is great. I have several of their appliances and will continue to buy from them. I have a coffee pot from them, microwave oven, mixer and a convection oven. All of them still work as perfect today as they did when I bought them initially.I tell everybody to buy from them because their products are nice looking, work great and last a long time.

                Hamilton Beach - shame on you. Husband got a breakfast sandwich maker for Christmas &amp; found it to overheat (badly!!), causing the paint to pucker. (we knew it was defective as our son also rc'd one for Christmas &amp; his works great) I emailed Hamilton Beach &amp; was told that their ""limited warranty"" is for 30 days... doesn't matter that it was purchased 11/9 for a Christmas present, so we would have to pay shipping for a replacement ($9.99 - almost 1/2 the total cost new!). Did I mention that we had to get a gift receipt to prove when &amp; where it was purchased? After 10 emails back &amp; forth, attaching copies of the product &amp; the gift receipt a total of 4 times I called the 800# (as my last email said that the shipping charge was now $12.99) with hopes that there was someone who would be willing to discuss this, was on hold for 18 minutes, and then was treated like a waste of Cassandra, NC's time. ""Customer Service"", I think not. Needless to say we will NEVER EVER purchase anything in the future from Hamilton Beach. Warning for all our friends &amp; others as to how they treat their customers as their way of thinking appears to be you bought it, it's yours, even if it's defective on their end.

                Do not buy their blender! I had an Osterizer from the 1980s that did a great job until a child pulled it off the counter last year. One year into a new Hamilton Beach, I've replaced the jar twice as the base chipped during washing, the lid vent never closed properly and has to be held down while in use, the button labels have all worn off and it blends poorly compared to the old Osterizer. I will be searching thrift stores for an oldie but goody. Plus an extremely short power cord. Don't waste your time and money with a Hamilton Beach blender.

                I bought a microwave a little over a year ago. A few months ago, the bottom of it started to rust and flake. Not sure why, I don't use it a lot and I've never seen anything like that. The vents on the inside started to rust as well. A week ago it started smelling like wires were burning. This is the 3rd one I've had issues  with. I bought them because the price is reasonable and I like them. This is disappointing because now I have to buy another one and it will be the 4th one in less than 4 years. I didn't wanna give the the 1 star, their products suck!

                When contacted about our defective coffee pot, they offered all kinds of STUPID solutions that I knew (and told them) wouldn’t change anything. After several failed attempts they asked us to return our unit for evaluation, not mentioning that it could take 6 weeks to get results!...Like, NO COFFEE POT FOR 6 WEEKS! 😤 We emailed them several times, but obviously NOBODY cares!

                Their service is  horrible. I ordered almost 2 weeks ago, have not received my order, have not received any update regarding my order AND I have currently been on hold for 56 minutes to find out what is going on with my order. I will never order from them again

                These people gave me the most awful customer service I've ever experienced in life. 1. The representatives are clueless. 2. The wait time to speak to a clueless representative is over an hour. 3. They lied about my shipment just to sell something. 4. The managers are extremely lazy. 5.  They have no idea what customer service means. 6. Dont give these crooks your money!!

                My gosh!  Bought their expensive can opener and a couple years down the line it quits working.  Try to send them an e-mail asking why?  You can't get there from here without signing up for racutan, whatever that is, and there is no way to get into the website without doing that.  No phone number given. Think I am ever again buying H-B?  Think again.  They are ""done"" as far as I ( and the folks I relate this experience to) are concerned.  NO MORE H-B.  I consider my purchase was a cheap rip-off.

                This is by far the worst company I have dealt with for customer ""service.""   When I called to complain about a blender that does not blend due to poor design of pitcher/blade.  The person I spoke to could not have cared less.  I was not looking for a replacement just to alert the company of a design flaw (in my opinion).  I am 70 years old so I have had a few blenders in my life from which to compare.  They just lost a customer.  I'll not buy any of their appliances in the future.  When I stated that fact to the rep.  She said OK.

                This is simply the WORST company and support department I've dealt with since ever. They FORCE you to do pay a very convenient shipping charge. No pick-up options or similar. It is a very subtle way to ""deny"" your warranty claim. The company behind it and the support department don't care about fairness with consumers, they just want to get their money. In the event, something goes wrong and a warranty claim is required, be ready to ""pay"" to get it replaced. The company expects consumers to  ""pay"" almost a very convenient 50% price of what the unit cost was to get it replaced. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, just throw it away or go straight to your Government Consumer Protection department or Attorney's General Office and call AMAZON and leave a seller's feedback. With that said, I simply cannot support this company and those very inconvenient warranty practices. I really do not recommend buying from them. If you still like the brand and product, suggest to buy it from a major department store (Walmart, Target, or similar) that you can simply return it if anything goes wrong with it, or get another brand that supports practices that are more consumer-friendly.

                I purchased the Hamilton Beach 2-way flexbrew coffee maker. I would suggest cusomers do your research before buying this coffee maker. The single brew constantly has coffee grinds in the coffee, 2 times out of 4 coffee grinds are in my coffee. even after going through the troubleshooting steps to correct the issue. I would suggest customers do some additional research on coffee makers before buying this one.

                I hate giving them even one star. Everything about their warranty and customer service is awful and actually quite disgusting on an economic scale and consumer scale. I have never been so disappointed in a company in my 52 years of living. They have wasted so much of my time just trying to return an item. I have officially said screw it. It is no longer worth my time after phone calls, taking pictures, writing emails and not getting responses...so I'm writing follow up emails...  makes one wonder if they are going under. If so, good. You reep what you sew. just do not buy anything from Hamilton beach or from a company selling their product. Consider that your consumer to consumer warning.  Thanks for reading.

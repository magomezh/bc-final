                Ordered a wireless charger, came a month later and charges so slowly (when it charges because it is sometimes capricious)

                I have 2 Belkin web cams used to monitor a second property as part of security needs purchased in 2014 and 2015, Both work perfectly. <br/><br/>However this week Belkin announced that they are shutting down the service that supports them and bricking both cameras in a months time. <br/><br/>So I have 2 working items that will be bricked in a month. I have a security device that will be inoperable in a month and no way of  changing it due to lockdown. I have a property I will be unable to monitor in a months time leaving it unprotected. And I will have to fork out money I do not have due to no income during lockdown to replace the service after lockdown,<br/><br/>And this is all with only 1 months warning, when nothing previously informed to me or advertised on their product  gave warning that this could happen.<br/><br/>The one thing I can say is that when looking at a replacement service, Belkin will be excluded from even being considered. I can also say that I will never buy another Belkin product in my life.<br/><br/>But if you want to buy goods from a company which is willing with only 1 months notice to brick something you purchased during a worldwide pandemic when that item is actually needed but can't be replaced because of legal restrictions put in place by your government, feel free to buy from them.

                Faulty screen protector... spoke to Belkin customer services in early February 2020. Refund agreed, £29.99. Multiple emails &amp; complicated process. Then receive a mail saying allow 2-3 weeks for them to process the refund - and a further 30 days for the monies to be posted back to my account. <br/><br/>Emails now saying please allow a further 120 days (4 months) !

                VARNING FÖR BELKIN PRODUKTER !<br/><br/>Belkin har satt i system att sälja produkter som kräver någon form av internet baserad styrning eller att spara i cloud. För några år sedan köpte jag en Belkin baby- monitor. Efter några år meddelade Belkin att de slutar stödja produktens funktioner (krävdes ett internetbaserad medlemskap). Och då var produkten helt plötsligt värdelös. <br/>Sedan köpte jag 4 st. övervakningskameror Belkin NetCam som också kräver internetbaserad styrning. Nu i går kom beskedet att de slutar stödja dessa kameror och då garantin är slut så sker ingen kompensation. 4 st. Kameror till ett värde av ca. 3000kr obrukbara nu. Och kamerorna är inte ens 3-år gamla. <br/><br/>Belkin har satt i system att på detta vis lura sina kunder. <br/>KÖP INTE BELKIN PRODUKTER VAD DE ÄN MÅ VARA !<br/><br/>WARNING FOR BELKIN PRODUCTS!<br/><br/> Belkin has put in place systems to sell products that require some form of internet based control or to save in the cloud.  A few years ago I bought a Belkin baby monitor.  After a few years, Belkin announced that they would stop supporting the product's features (an internet-based membership was required).  And then the product was suddenly useless.<br/> Then I bought 4 pieces.  surveillance cameras Belkin NetCam that also requires Internet-based control.  Now yesterday came the message that they stop supporting these cameras and when the warranty is over no compensation will be made.  4 pcs.  Cameras worth approx. 3000 sw/kr useless now.  And the cameras are not even 3 years old.<br/><br/> Belkin has put in place systems to fool its customers in this way.<br/> DO NOT BUY BELKIN PRODUCTS WHAT THEY MUST BE!

                Do not buy Belkin products.  Very bad company.  Very bad customer service.  They are not honest (dishonest).  They took me for thousands of dollars when I purchased camera systems from them for home and business, then once I got it up and running, they shut the service down.  This equipment is useless now - I can use as a door stop or dust collector.   No refund unless you just bought it recently.    I complained, and they don't care.   Stay as far away from Belkin as you can.  Do not touch with a ten foot pole.

                Do it buy from Belkin.com  there is no support via orders placed online over the phone. You get stupid foreigners who cannot speak and understand English. I had to keep repeating myself and when I asked for a supervisor she lied and said none are available. I paid for expedited shipping and never received my product. UPS dumped my package off at a wrong address belonging to the post office which is an annex and not to 607 E Blanco Rd which is the post office that it was addressed to go to. So I called to request the refund of ONLY the shipping because it will take another two days for the po dunk post office to retrieve the package and deliver it and the dumb chic kept saying you want a refund of the item. I said no just the shipping and continued to argue that it was delivered!! No it was NOT. UPS lied and the postmaster verified this!!!

                Expecting a refund for a faulty iPhone 11 Pro Max screen protector. The refund was originally requested in February and I was told would take 4 weeks. I have just received an email that it will take 120 days (17 weeks) due to Covid-19! This is utter rubbish and a deliberate attempt to hold on to cash which they are liable to refund. I am seriously considering rather opening a small claims court case for my money to be returned, and then they can be liable for the court costs too. My review will change if the refund is received in the next 7 days. Failing that, I will pursue other options.

                How long does it take to process a refund!!!<br/><br/>Going through Belkin's long not user-friendly refund service I was told I have to wait 4 weeks to receive my refund. I was not happy with that response, but I thought okay. <br/><br/>Due date of the refund, I received a response and have been told, I will now not receive my refund for another 120 days!!!<br/><br/>Disgusted and Disappointed! An international company fighting over £49,99. So ashamed and I will never use there services or buy a product from this joke of a company again.

                Belkin charge cable USB - mirco USB overheated and smouldering; nothing was connected for charging on micro USB side. <br/>Firstly, getting hold of someone at customer service is difficult/impossible. Website is not user-friendly, no means to interact with mail and local business not accessible for customer help. Finally reached out to customer service via chat. They did not care that this almost created fire in my house; let alone that it will cause fire in other people's homes. They were indifferent and asked - so what do you want us to do? Asking for replacement, they told me to call number in US, when I am in Europe.<br/>Find there accessibility, care and support sub-zero. Will avoid their products - not worth it.

                Brought a £29.99 screen protector which has replacement cover. <br/><br/>Damaged and followed all protocols for a replacement only to be told I have to print off a form, fill it in and return it for a refund.<br/><br/>Who uses printers in 2020 ?

                Bought a Belkin KVM and it started smoking (luckily didn't burn down the server room!). The RMA process has taken 2 months so far and they have now sent a completely different unit as a replacement. Awful.

                Belkin cancelled my order and didn’t tell me. After waiting a week I contacted them on Twitter for an update - it was hard to find their customer service email address support@belkin or belkincares@belkin .com . Eventually they said they’d resend it, but to the wrong address. So I emailed back to correct them. Then they said they couldn’t ship it to me at all. <br/><br/>Terrible customer service and a waste of time. Don’t buy from Belkin there are plenty of other companies out there who are better.

                DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.  <br/><br/>I have several home automation devices manufactured and distributed by Belkin.  One of these products failed and caused substantial damage to my home, only by pure luck alone nobody was seriously injured.  I've reported this to Belkin and they seem completely disinterested. <br/><br/>To compound matters when attempting to reach Belkin via telephone its not uncommon to be kept on hold for HOURS and i mean hours on hold.   <br/><br/>Disgusting company that holds complete disdain for it's customers.

                Customer service who couldn't even take a serial or model number after it being spelled out and phonetically repeated, too busy talking over you to provide support. After disabling switch access to alexa they can provide no assistance because we do not have the serial number or product number 12 remote switches useless now and at the price im furious.I would recommend avoiding wemo products like the plague

                Wish I could give 0 stars. <br/><br/>The products are totally overpriced and break. They advertise their iPhone protectors as shatter proof, I haven't even dropped my phone and it's the fourth time it needs to be replaced. The glass protector itself is £30-40, which is ridiculous so you would expect better quality. Despite there being 'unlimited replacements' they take about 14 working days to come... The whole process of getting in contact with an agent takes forever, you need to go onto their website, wait for an agent (I've currently been waiting for ten minutes, still not connected), and explain the whole situation, with photographic evidence (this process takes 20 minutes once connected). No idea why Apple uses this product in their stores because all this company does it waste your time.

                Customer service is non existent. Despite their fancy site with chat etc it is impossible to get even a simple question answered. The chat line does not exist, the phone so called help line, speaks only Klingon. All our belkin stuff is being junked now and replaced with some that we can actually get to work. No possible way to email an internet based company. You could hardly make this up.

                I paid $60 for the Belkin wireless charger in February. It stopped working within 3 weeks.<br/>I returned the defective product and was told my purchase would be refunded in a “timely “ manner. It is now April 23rd and, I have yet to receive my refund.<br/>I will NEVER buy another Belkin product or recommend them to ANYONE.

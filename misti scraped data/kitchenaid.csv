                Honestly, does any one really rave about Kitchenaide quality.  The only thing amazing with satin black fridge and stove is the look.  The slide in ceramic top stove use is dismal.  Slow heating elements makes it frustrating.  Coming from a coil electric stove this is just disappointing.  Yeah, it is easier to clean ( sort of) but use is frustrating.  Why should one have to wait so long for the element to heat up and get ready.  The touch screen is not easier.  What’s wrong with dials that one can’t reset by accident.  Fridge looks great but space inside is less.  So much is taken up with the water/ice making portion that the vegg and fruit boxes are way too small.  The interior is 80% plastic that won’t last.  The interior temp. Set at 38 freezes stuff on the top shelf.  Go figure. The only appliance of the set of three I spent more than $5000 for that is worthy of praise is the dishwasher.  Definitely will not buy another thing with Kitchenaide written on it.

                Horrible customer service. I called several times and talk with 4 people to get a replacement for a toaster. Twice I was told that they placed the order but I never got it. I will not call back as I was placed on hold every time for at least one hour.

                I received my heavy duty KitchenAid mixer for a Christmas present December 2019 I started having problems with it exactly after a year I called and asked what can be done and they said sorry there is no warranty it's only for the first year why pay $600 for a machine when you don't get customer service or a warranty is longer than a year now my mixer is toast and I have to go and buy another one I won't buying KitchenAid again the sad part is I have all the attachments to go with my KitchenAid mixer the pasta maker all that kind of stuff so I'm screwed either way...so if anyone is really thinking about get one DONT BUY ONE...GET SOMETHING ELSE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Pretty sad KitchenAid does not stand behind their products

                Loses a star simply because the website is so awful. You are encouraged to register your warranty on the KitchenAid website with the lure of free goodies if you do. However, the warranty form - as noted by a previous reviewer - simply crashes out with an error at the end of the process. Bit of a waste of time and doesn't make a good impression. It appears this has been a problem for some time.

                We bought three mixers for company X'mas party draw last December.  However, after we received the order we decided to return two mixers for credit and hoping to get something else.  Then we returned one at the end of Dec and returned the second one in mid-Jan 2020.  As of now, we still have not received any refunds on the credit card after numerous calls to Customer Service and the CS supervisor. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY CONSUMERS BUY DIRECT FROM KITCHEN-AID.  IT IS BETTER OFF TO BUY DIRECTLY FROM ANY RETAILERS.

                My wife bought a Kitchenaid Artisan toaster a while ago. We were uanable to register it through the Belgian contact details provided as there was never any answer. Shortly after purchase, the right hand 2 toaster elements stopped working and again we were unable to make contact with Kitchen aid. So we currently have half a working toaster and are unable to contact the manufacturer.

                I bought a stand up mixer on line with an estimated delivery day of 04/09/20. I also received an email  saying it was shipped. When I didn't receive the order I called KitchenAid and they told me it was ready to ship but the could not tell me ""when it will be actually ship"". I then asked to cancel the order and I was told that they can't because it was ready to be ship, but they don't know when they will ship it. That is ridiculous they lied about the delivery day, they never ship it and now they can't cancel because ""it is ready to ship???"" Worst customer service, They are quick to get your money but they will not fulfill the orders you paid already. That is theft and false advertisement. They also disconnected the order status page so you can't check any progress on the order. Worst company. I will never buy anything from this company again

                The mixer arrived in good condition except the height adjustment was way off. I researched solutions for this and found that there is an adjustment screw and there is a test you can do with a dime which allows you to adjust the bowl height if it needs to be adjusted a minimal amount however mine came from the factory so far out it could not be adjusted so I contacted customer service because I had read that they would walk you through the solutions to fix it and if it could not be fixed they would send you a new one and you would send the defective one back.<br/><br/>Well, after speaking with Alex the customer service guy he instructed me to take a video of the dime test after each adjustment of the screw and attach it to an email he sent me. He was very courteous and I did just that. He also said call or use chat on their website to get back with customer service after sending and the agent would have access to the video and would view it and come up with a solution. I proceeded the next day to go into chat on their website and after finally connecting with an agent was told I would have to call to have the issue resolved.<br/><br/>So Alex was wrong about that. I called customer service and explained my problem and was told there was no attached video so I immediately sent another email which they got. Then this barrage of questions started while she was viewing the video asking if I adjusted the screw and of course it was evident in the video that I had and she thought she saw the dime move at which time I told her it could have been a quarter and not moved so she put me on hold so someone else could take a look at the video and then came back and asked if I had tried other positions with the screw and I said I had tried several positions in the half turn that was all the screw would move and that I had had a mixer that was this same model for several years so I knew what I was talking about. She finally said they would send me a replacement and that I was to send the defective one back.<br/><br/>This was clear cut from the beginning that I had a defective product but the agent had to insult my intelligence before admitting I had a defective mixer. I will most likely avoid Kitchenaid products in the future.<br/><br/>User's recommendation:<br/>If you get a good one out of the box the first time great but if you have to contact customer service prepare to have your intelligence insulted.

                I purchased the most expensive French door refrigerator kitchenmaid had three years ago. After a month I called them to say the ice maker was taking a week and a half to fill the bin. They came out and looked at it and said that's the way it is so I had to go purchase an ice making machine. All off my kitchen appliances are kitchenaid. Four thousand dollars for this product that will not make ice! Don't buy kitchenaid! They will not help you if something goes wrong.

                We bought a KitchenAid fridge, KRFC704FPS, Sept 2019, and it’s not cooling.  This is the second time we’ve called for the same issue.  It’s been two weeks and come to find out, they don’t have the part.  Now I have to wait for it to come in and when it does come in, I have to wait for the technician to schedule an appointment.  They are saying nothing else they can do.  We’ve only had this  fridge for only 6 months brand new.  Just remodeled our kitchen and my appliances are KitchenAid.  This fridge was NOT cheap.  I expected more from KitchenAid.

                Household Mixer model KHM512IC<br/>So cute. My first mixer. I bought it to make my daughter’s second birthday cake last year. Since then, I’ve used it 3 times. It stopped mid-use during the third use. I’m very disappointed. I should have done my due-diligence. I sent Kitchen Aid an email last week and haven’t heard back. It sounds like there is a piece of broken plastic inside.

                We purchased a $4000 refrigerator thinking it would be top of the line.  The ice maker broke a few months ago, we called for service and it was temporarily fixed. It broke again and we called for service once again, this time, the service person never showed up.  When I called to see what went on and to reschedule, I was advised that they had tried to call to let me know that no one was available and that I should not have waited for them to show.  The thing is, my cell records all calls answered or not, no call ever came from them.  In fact, I received an email on the day they claim to have called, the email was to confirm the appointment.  The item is not dependable and the customer service is much below what I had expected.

                I have just been onto Kitchen Aid  Customer Service UK with regard to a small repair to my Very expensive Artisan kettle. I was informed that they DO NOT repair small electrical goods that ARE OUT OF WARRANTY. Not bad for a company that has just been voted top 3 in best toasters that cannot be repaired!!!!!!!! My advise Is ask before buying a Kitchen Aid small electric appliance where to get it repaired better still buy a cheaper one and throw it away when broken. Vivienne

                I purchased a KitchenAid kettle from John Lewis &amp; Partners. The product looks good. However, I tried to register my product for warrantee (3 years on this product) but their standard form does not accept my postcode. I tried with and without space in between the letters and characters. So I decided to call customer services UK. All I achieved with this call was pressing buttons for this and that service which took 6 minutes, then I was given different phone numbers for different services and the robot just hang up. This is not customer service but a waste of customer time without any result. For goodness sake change your non-functional form to allow customers to register our products.

                Bought a $4000 Kitchenaid 5 drawer refirg 4 years ago... have had nothing but problems.. Must have had 20 service calls for issues constantly happening with this piece of crap.  Kitchenaid corporate customer service is no help, courteous enough, but they cannot or will not help.  It's obviously a lemon but unless you want to bring kitchenaid into court you have no recourse but the throw the thing into a landfill and never ever buy kitchenaid and warn as many friends as possible and write reviews to help someone avoid this debacle ... UNBELIEVABLE... I spoke to the owner of the service company and he simply told me to throw it out and get a simple single evap system refrig because he has nothing but problems servicing these...WAY TO GO KITCHEAID.... never again

Reached out 2 weeks later, they said the order got ""stuck"" in the system and that they would push it through. Another 2 weeks passed, still no delivery. I reach out and this is the answer I received: <br/><br/>KitchenAid: ""Thank you for your patience. That order actually got stuck in the system. You should try placing the order again online. This order is not being processed. I am so sorry for the inconvenience. Is the charge still pending on your card?.... I am actually looking at the stock on that pan. It appears to be a discontinued item."" <br/><br/>Me: ""The last chat they told me it was stuck in the system but that she would push it through on January 17th... I know it's not your fault but is there any way this can be resolved more quickly? It was meant to be a gift for someone. I will take a look at my visa""<br/><br/>KitchenAid ""I am really sorry. They would not be able to push the order through if they do not have the item in stock. I believe that may be what happened. Is there anything else that I may assist you with right now?<br/><br/>Me: ""Yes, I did not receive an email or notification to advise the item was not in stock. I have a receipt confirmation email that the item was purchased.""<br/><br/>KichenAId: ""Regrettably there are no emails sent if an order gets stuck in the system. I apologize again for your inconvenience.""<br/><br/>?! Wow. Not even a solution offered... Hope this doesn't happen often.

                I bought the 14 cup drip coffee pot with a full year warranty and have had to replaced it more then 5 times due to poor quality. They are now refusing to uphold their warranty to replace or refund. They want to give me a cheaper one that cost less then what I paid for. I'm planning on filing a consumer report complaint with the federal government. Everyone needs to do this so the agency will get involved with the quality of kitchenaid products. If we just post here, nothing will be done about their defective products and poor service. We MUST make them liable to stand behind their products. The consumer protection agency needs as many complaints as they can get before they start an investigation. DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH STEALING OUR MONEY.

                I ordered my stand mixer during Black Friday online. That same day I walked into a BestBuy and saw the same exact mixer for $120 off. I called Kitchenaid the next business day to see if they would honor the price difference and even provided proof of it and they said they could not and just told me to send it back. What a way to keep a lifelong customer... <br/><br/>Now it is the middle of January and i have yet to receive my refund. I have called 5-6 time and always get the same answer. ""Nothing I can do it's in our warehouse, they have to issue the refund""

                We have had a kitchenAid KSRT25CRSS01 refrigerator for 14 years. Over that time we have had 3 repairs that were needed. None too expensive. Biggest problem was water filter assembly leak which needed a replacement.<br/> I want to describe the most recent problem which might be able to someone some money. <br/>One day we noticed a puddle of water in the front left side of the refrigerator. Found out at the bottom of the freezer door there was a waterline elbow that was leaking. I thought it would be easy to find the part online and replace it. But I soon found out that this part is not on any of the parts diagrams. I searched multiple sites and spoke with reps who could not find it. Finally, I was able to identify that it was a Westinghouse 5/16” elbow. Then I was able to start getting prices. Unbelievably, the part sold anywhere from $10-$30 plus shipping! Not willing to pay that amount I contacted local plumbing supply shops. None of them carried the part.<br/>To make a longer story short, I finally found a part with that description online at a swimming pool parts supplier. If you need it, it was $1.79+shipping (gulp, was $6!). But for $8, I had the part delivered and it works fine. Here are the details: company: FreshWaterSystems.com. Part: John Guest Union Elbow Polypropylene 5/16.<br/>Good luck!

                I bought a Kitchenaid Professional 5 Mixer a year ago on 12/18. It is now 13 months later and the mixer broke. It will not turn on at times and it has developed a loud clunking sound when it runs. I contact Kitchen Aid about this and because it is 13 months old and only has a 1 year warranty, it is not covered. Save you money and buy a different brand, they do not make them like they use to. <br/>Now I have to go return all the attachments I got for Christmas.

                Purchased a Kitchenaid Induction range         ( Model  YKIRS608BSS ) a few years ago and have had nothing but problems.  We became well acquainted with the service technicians during the first year as they were out constantly to replace the main control board. It was not successful but our warranty expired. I checked with the store and they said there were so many complaints that Kitchenaid issued a 'stop sell' on this model. After sending a scathing email to Kitchenaid,  they gave me another year of warranty.  They came out again with another board but still crap. What good is warranty if they can't fix an obviously faulty design. It's not rocket science as induction has been in use for years in Europe.  Avoid their large appliances like the plague, as they don't stand behind their products.

                We're in the midst of the worst customer service experience we've ever had. We purchased Kitchenaid's high end 42"" refrigerator and after using it only 6 mos it no longer works. It simply does not cool or freeze anything. The worst part is that this happened nearly six weeks ago and we are still waiting for the right 'specialist' to come and repair it. He would be the 3rd technician to come to our home and in each instance it has taken a week or more to get the next person scheduled. This is all happening throughout the holiday season, so we've had no refrigeration since mid-December and now into the 2nd week of the new year. No one at Kitchenaid will prioritize or escalate things on our behalf and each time I call we are on hold an increbily long time, on today's call it was 55mins - unfortunately that's not unusual. So we've lost the entire contents of the frig &amp; freezer and have been living out of a cooler in the garage throughout the entire holidays but that doesn't seem to be any concern to Kitchenaid. $7500 for a refrigerator and now waiting 6 weeks for the ""right"" technician to repair it, if that's even possible. Do yourself a favor and stay way from KItchenaid.

                On Christmas day we realized there was something wrong with our KA refrigerator because we had no ice and the freezer was above the correct temperature.  On New Years eve the repairman came out and told us the compressor had gone out.  A $1500. repair on a $3200. machine.  Thank goodness we took out an extended warranty.  Very disappointed with this refrigerator.  All of my appliances are KA and have always been pleased with them.  Next time I will think twice about buying KA

                I bought a Kitchenaid mixer with stand. It came with a notice stating if you register your product, you get 25% off your first attachment purchase.<br/><br/>The fine print says Offer available on purchase of select attachments made from official KitchenAid website only, excludes some model numbers (lists them). I registered and didn't know how to get 25% off so I went to the online chat at which time the person said I had to phone and that was better anyway because the phone service had better details than the website. I wanted to buy the food processor attachment which is on sale for $199 online (plus the 25% coupon I wanted to use). The phone person told me I can't order online, I must order via phone.<br/><br/>Her price was $229 and then I could get 25% off. Her Manager said the same. I pointed out Kitchenaid is one company so why do they have 2 prices and the flyer that came with my mixer said to order online but I needed a code.<br/><br/>They refused to provide a code and said my only option was the more expensive option. This is false advertising and Kitchenaid is untrustworthy.

                One wouldn't expect that a large company like kitchenaid or Whirlpool would have such horrible customer service, but they are the worst.  My daughter bought a knife block for me for Christmas on-line.  I received an email notification. 2 days later, I received another email advising it was cancelled which I forwarded to my daughter.  She was informed that when the purchaser and receiver of the item is not the same person, their system will automatically cancel the order. Hello, that is what people do at Christmas all over the world. The company however did not return the money to my daughter.<br/><br/>It has been a month since she first ordered it and she still hasnt received her money back.  On top of that, their customer service employees accuse her of trying to scam the company. How on earth this company is still around I fail to understand.  Shame on you Kitchenaid and whirlpool for being untrustworthy yourselves.  You website guarantees a 7-10 day turnaround for refunds.  And to the incompetent customer service representatives, may karma be fierce!

                I had such a horrible experience ordering through kitchenaid <br/>It has now been over a month and I'm hoping things get settled properly because I do not want to call in again. <br/><br/>On nov 25th I placed an order for a knife block set for my mom for christmas. On nov 27th I checked my acct and the money was taken out and then I recieved an email from my mom which stated that the order was cancelled. So I called customer service and they stated that since it was shipped to one name but paid by another their system cancels it in case its fraud. Ok no problem. <br/><br/>The guy asks if I want to re purchase it but put it in my name, i said yes. The guy tells me that it's actually going to be cheaper cause there was an extra 20% off for that day. Perfect! Well some how it came out to $.50 more. I said whatever just place the order it's only $.50. A couple days later I check my acct and the money's been taken out but now it $6 more than what I was supposed to pay.....<br/><br/> so I call in again and i get the same guy. He apologizes and sends me out a cheque for $10 because they cant go any less than that. Sweet! <br/><br/>Just over a week goes by and neither myself nor my mom recieve any emails regarding this purchase so I ordered her a different set (different brand) at canadian tire which she picked up the next day and told her if the kitchen aid one shows up to send it back.<br/><br/> My mom arrives home one day to find the package at her door because another person living in her building let the purolator guy in so she couldn't just refuse the package. So she looks for a form that we were told would be with it to return it, there was no form. So my mom takes it back to purolator and they said no problem they have done this before and they ship it back. I gave it a while to ensure that the package would be delivered back til I called in to inquire about my refund. The woman told me that we did it wrong and that we needed them to mail us out a form to return it.... well the guy i talked to and their website say different! <br/><br/>I then had to call purolator to find out the tracking number and was pretty much called a liar when I explained how things were done, then she laughs at me and says she cant give me a refund.... I asked how I would find the tracking of this package not a refund.... wow.... my mom then has to go to purolator and gets it all sorted. *note: this was the day before new years eve. So I decide to wait til I am able to call in to kitchen aid again which was this morning. <br/><br/>I give all the information and am excited to be done with this month long ordeal. Well the woman comes back and says that since they sent that cheque (which I never cashed) they can only give me a credit. I dont want a credit. I want nothing to do with kitchen aid at this moment so no I will rip the cheque up, send it back or take a photo of it with void written on  it and email it to them. I just want my money back. I was placed on hold many times for long periods of time to finally hear I will be getting my money back but first the woman has to try and belittle me a bit like I'm trying to scam them for $10. Somehow in their minds I'm coming out on top.... ummm no I just want my money back and I will tear up the cheque thanks.... <br/><br/>Now I have to wait a month or more to see the refund on my acct.... let's hope this is true....

                I was so excited to get the beautiful kitchen aid mixer with glass bowl.  When I was mixing dough it made the glass bowl lock itself to the base.  I tried googling how to remove from the base and it wouldn’t budge.  On YouTube a reviewer said to place it on the floor and straddle it and turn the bowl.  Lol!!!!   I actually tried this and every possible other maneuver and it wouldn’t come off the base.  Then I put it on the counter and tried removing it again the normal way  and it fell off the counter and the glass bowl had broken.  Sadly, I had to order a stainless bowl and I will never ever buy a glass bowl to be used with a mixer.  It doesn’t seem safe anyway.  Long story short the kitchen aid does have a great motor and design aesthetic however the glass bowl shouldn’t be used.  The quality is great otherwise!

                I recently ordered a KitchenAid mixer as a gift.  Since the gift was not for someone in my immediate family, my billing address and my shipping addresses were different.  The website actually offers to have you buy a product as a gift, and since many gifts are purchased for people who do not live at my address, it never occurred to me that it would not be possible to pay for a product and have it sent to it's recipient at a different address.  Apparently, for Kitchenaid, this circumstance is one of several that will bump your order into a ""possibly fraudulent situation"" that will put your order on an indefinite hold.  I was sent a generic email five days after placing the order that said my order was not shipped and would not ship until further notice and there was no way to tell when or if this order would be filled.   It didn't indicate my name or order number or product ordered.  I called Kitchenaid directly and was put on hold for 38 minutes.  When a customer service representative answered, she could not give me any information other than the same information in the email -- that yes, I had placed an order but there was no way to tell where the product was or when or if it could be delivered.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The customer service supervisor explained that our order had been sent to their fraud department for one of many reasons.  Our order could have contained an incorrectly spelled name, or we could have entered a zip code incorrectly or ""any number of reasons"" but no reason that could be specifically attached to our order.  Further, the fraud department was not reachable on the phone, ever, nor could she talk to them and she didn't know when or if she ever would be able to speak to them.  Our only recourse was to wait for another generically sent email that would explain that our order was either sent through or cancelled.  The fraud department would have made their decision within 24 to 48 hours but the email of explanation would take up to four days.  At this point, it has been five days.  One of my biggest problems is that the customer service representatives were unhelpful, unable to confirm or explain what was going on with the order and, although the company said they hadn't charged my card, they actually have.  The money is out of my account and I have no product and no order delivery time or date.  It has been explained to me by customer service that I could be a scammer, she used those words exactly, and that all of this vague information was for my protection.  This is ridiculously poor customer service.  I  should be able to expect a company that has taken funds from my account to be able to tell me where the product I purchased is and when it will arrive.  I went through three phone calls and three people before finally cancelling my order.  The last person I spoke with was able to explain the order process and where our order seemed to have been delayed.  She did suggest cancelling the order and beginning again at a somewhat later date.  Apparently engraving (which we had ordered on our Kitchenaid mixer) is not always available, so if we wait to re-order, engraving might not be available.  Honestly, I would order through a third party company with reliable and good customer service.  We, literally, spent three hours on the phone, most of it on hold, in order to cancel an order that was placed five days ago.  Considering how much commerce happens on the internet, Kitchenaid needs to up their game considerably.

                We purchased a new Kitchen Aid fridge within a year and a half had two repairs done . Finally the company we purchased the fridge from gave us a new one . This is the fun part every year after year for 4 years now fridge goes warm and it ices inside . Called the manufacturer and they do nothing for you . Last visit from the repair people was 500.00 dollars. So my suggestion to anyone in the market for a fridge be aware.

                Do not buy if you think about service and warranty. I got it and had issued from the first month. I neglect to report it timely. I rented my house and my tenant started using it. They had the same problem. We called the service. They said there was a delay receiving hot water: we need to reset it. They charged me $120. In two weeks this time, they said motor is faulty and it is out of warranty. I decided to get rid of it and purchased a new dishwasher. They did not responded positively. I even told them to come and check if the machine has factory faulty. They said no. DO NOT BUY IT. I had a much better warranty experience with other companies.

                My wife finally decided to spend the money on an Artisan mixer. It came without the fill spout in the box. So I called the customer service number and was told the wait time was 39 minutes. Thinking this isn’t possible, I stayed on hold. After about 10 minutes I was told the wait time is still 33 minutes. I opted to use there email instead as I did not have time to sit on hold. I received a response that I would be contacted within 2 business days. After 3 go by with no communication, I call again. This time the wait was 11 minutes. I finally get a person and it was a harder process than expected.  Apparently someone else was registered with my phone number. We moved a year ago so maybe the old owner of our number did register. Understandable. But it confused the lady on the phone. She finally put me on hold for a while to look into something. When she returned, she took my information and they are supposed to be sending the part. We will see as it can take up to 10 business days. Which is also confusing as I could have just returned the unit as damaged instead of trying to save them the headache.

                I have a double Kitchen Aid oven and cook every day. Lower oven light bulb went out and when it was replaced it blew out all bulbs.  The repair man told me that the electric panel would need to be replaced , costing more than $1,000 and that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new oven.  Bear in mind that the ovens work perfectly, but what a joke and a rip off to need to spend over $1,000 to have lights in the ovens.   I would never buy another appliance from Kitchen Aid.  When I told our local dealer that I was going to try to have a reasonable conversation with Kitchen Aid about my dilemma, they said “ good luck”. That says it all!    Marilyn Smith, Dallas , Tx

                I purchased 3 major kitchen aide products during my kitchen remodel. I was encouraged to purchase these products because of a rebate kitchen aide was offering. 4 months later I still have no rebate and was told that although the items were purchased during the promotional period and paid for the delivered invoice was after the promotional period. If anyone has done a kitchen remodel you would know that installation can be delayed. I spent 8,000 on my appliances and Kitchen Aide will not pay me my 250$ rebate. I will never purchase another item from them again and will make sure I tell everyone I know what has happened . Very disappointed in this company

                Built a home 3 years ago and the builder put in Kitchen aid appliances. <br/><br/>First, the dishwasher doesn't dry ANYTHING!!!! The side vents are fake and the service guy admitted the product sucks ... HUH!?<br/><br/>Second, the fridge has a two doors, and one of them has a sealing panel attached to it, and when you open and close that door the other should close, but it doesn't, so unless you know this and close the other door two you wake up to pools of water on the floor and a half melted fridge!!! UGH!<br/><br/>Third, I was stupid enough to buy 3 under the counter fridges for wine, cocktail mixes, etc. HUGE mistake. After the first year one fo them had the=digtail control panel come UNGLUED!!! YES, THEY USE GLUE!!! After arguing with the service center they repaired it for free.<br/><br/>Guess what I just noticed? The second ones digital panel came unglued and the wine went bad.. smells horrible. Once again had to escalate the issue to Care Resolutoin and they said we will pay for the $5 part but I have to p[ay for service call... really? It's a completely flawed design with GLUE! And I'm sure the 3rd one will eventually lose it's tackiness. I'm mad as a hornet! 4 refrigerates that suck.. all for the low low price of $6,400!!! I'm such a sucker.. I HOPE YOU WON'T BE!!

I attempted to order a stand mixer - placed the order, received the confirmation, saw the pending charge on my credit card, and then received an email that my order had been cancelled. I called to figure out the problem and they said it was because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I replaced the order over the phone, but never received a confirmation. The original charge was still pending on my credit card but the new purchase never showed up. I contacted KitchenAid and their representative said that the order had been cancelled because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I explained that this had happened before, and that I placed the order over the phone to make sure it didn't happen again and they said they didn't know what was wrong but their system didn't accept the order. I placed it AGAIN. The old charge was removed from my credit card, the new charge showed up as pending. I never received a confirmation of the order. A week later, after following up via email twice without response, the order showed up at my BILLING ADDRESS which I actively avoid shipping to because packages often get stolen.  Luckily this was not stolen but I will never order from KitchenAid again.

                I had such a horrible experience ordering through kitchenaid <br/>It has now been over a month and I'm hoping things get settled properly because I do not want to call in again. <br/><br/>On nov 25th I placed an order for a knife block set for my mom for christmas. On nov 27th I checked my acct and the money was taken out and then I recieved an email from my mom which stated that the order was cancelled. So I called customer service and they stated that since it was shipped to one name but paid by another their system cancels it in case its fraud. Ok no problem. <br/><br/>The guy asks if I want to re purchase it but put it in my name, i said yes. The guy tells me that it's actually going to be cheaper cause there was an extra 20% off for that day. Perfect! Well some how it came out to $.50 more. I said whatever just place the order it's only $.50. A couple days later I check my acct and the money's been taken out but now it $6 more than what I was supposed to pay.....<br/><br/> so I call in again and i get the same guy. He apologizes and sends me out a cheque for $10 because they cant go any less than that. Sweet! <br/><br/>Just over a week goes by and neither myself nor my mom recieve any emails regarding this purchase so I ordered her a different set (different brand) at canadian tire which she picked up the next day and told her if the kitchen aid one shows up to send it back.<br/><br/> My mom arrives home one day to find the package at her door because another person living in her building let the purolator guy in so she couldn't just refuse the package. So she looks for a form that we were told would be with it to return it, there was no form. So my mom takes it back to purolator and they said no problem they have done this before and they ship it back. I gave it a while to ensure that the package would be delivered back til I called in to inquire about my refund. The woman told me that we did it wrong and that we needed them to mail us out a form to return it.... well the guy i talked to and their website say different! <br/><br/>I then had to call purolator to find out the tracking number and was pretty much called a liar when I explained how things were done, then she laughs at me and says she cant give me a refund.... I asked how I would find the tracking of this package not a refund.... wow.... my mom then has to go to purolator and gets it all sorted. *note: this was the day before new years eve. So I decide to wait til I am able to call in to kitchen aid again which was this morning. <br/><br/>I give all the information and am excited to be done with this month long ordeal. Well the woman comes back and says that since they sent that cheque (which I never cashed) they can only give me a credit. I dont want a credit. I want nothing to do with kitchen aid at this moment so no I will rip the cheque up, send it back or take a photo of it with void written on  it and email it to them. I just want my money back. I was placed on hold many times for long periods of time to finally hear I will be getting my money back but first the woman has to try and belittle me a bit like I'm trying to scam them for $10. Somehow in their minds I'm coming out on top.... ummm no I just want my money back and I will tear up the cheque thanks.... <br/><br/>Now I have to wait a month or more to see the refund on my acct.... let's hope this is true....

                I was so excited to get the beautiful kitchen aid mixer with glass bowl.  When I was mixing dough it made the glass bowl lock itself to the base.  I tried googling how to remove from the base and it wouldn’t budge.  On YouTube a reviewer said to place it on the floor and straddle it and turn the bowl.  Lol!!!!   I actually tried this and every possible other maneuver and it wouldn’t come off the base.  Then I put it on the counter and tried removing it again the normal way  and it fell off the counter and the glass bowl had broken.  Sadly, I had to order a stainless bowl and I will never ever buy a glass bowl to be used with a mixer.  It doesn’t seem safe anyway.  Long story short the kitchen aid does have a great motor and design aesthetic however the glass bowl shouldn’t be used.  The quality is great otherwise!

                I ordered a mixer, and the order is being held up as possibly fraudulent. They won't say when it will be resolved. I see that somebody below has the exact same problem. If anyone is fraudulent, it's KitchenAid.com.

                I recently ordered a KitchenAid mixer as a gift.  Since the gift was not for someone in my immediate family, my billing address and my shipping addresses were different.  The website actually offers to have you buy a product as a gift, and since many gifts are purchased for people who do not live at my address, it never occurred to me that it would not be possible to pay for a product and have it sent to it's recipient at a different address.  Apparently, for Kitchenaid, this circumstance is one of several that will bump your order into a ""possibly fraudulent situation"" that will put your order on an indefinite hold.  I was sent a generic email five days after placing the order that said my order was not shipped and would not ship until further notice and there was no way to tell when or if this order would be filled.   It didn't indicate my name or order number or product ordered.  I called Kitchenaid directly and was put on hold for 38 minutes.  When a customer service representative answered, she could not give me any information other than the same information in the email -- that yes, I had placed an order but there was no way to tell where the product was or when or if it could be delivered.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The customer service supervisor explained that our order had been sent to their fraud department for one of many reasons.  Our order could have contained an incorrectly spelled name, or we could have entered a zip code incorrectly or ""any number of reasons"" but no reason that could be specifically attached to our order.  Further, the fraud department was not reachable on the phone, ever, nor could she talk to them and she didn't know when or if she ever would be able to speak to them.  Our only recourse was to wait for another generically sent email that would explain that our order was either sent through or cancelled.  The fraud department would have made their decision within 24 to 48 hours but the email of explanation would take up to four days.  At this point, it has been five days.  One of my biggest problems is that the customer service representatives were unhelpful, unable to confirm or explain what was going on with the order and, although the company said they hadn't charged my card, they actually have.  The money is out of my account and I have no product and no order delivery time or date.  It has been explained to me by customer service that I could be a scammer, she used those words exactly, and that all of this vague information was for my protection.  This is ridiculously poor customer service.  I  should be able to expect a company that has taken funds from my account to be able to tell me where the product I purchased is and when it will arrive.  I went through three phone calls and three people before finally cancelling my order.  The last person I spoke with was able to explain the order process and where our order seemed to have been delayed.  She did suggest cancelling the order and beginning again at a somewhat later date.  Apparently engraving (which we had ordered on our Kitchenaid mixer) is not always available, so if we wait to re-order, engraving might not be available.  Honestly, I would order through a third party company with reliable and good customer service.  We, literally, spent three hours on the phone, most of it on hold, in order to cancel an order that was placed five days ago.  Considering how much commerce happens on the internet, Kitchenaid needs to up their game considerably.

                I bought my wife a professional 5 plus mixer last Christmas.  She has used it 6 times this year.  She is now baking for Christmas and paint is mixed in the cookies.  My mother had the same issue except hers was 20 years old.   Do I have to buy a new flat beater every 5th use? <br/><br/>What a cheap product.

                We purchased a new Kitchen Aid fridge within a year and a half had two repairs done . Finally the company we purchased the fridge from gave us a new one . This is the fun part every year after year for 4 years now fridge goes warm and it ices inside . Called the manufacturer and they do nothing for you . Last visit from the repair people was 500.00 dollars. So my suggestion to anyone in the market for a fridge be aware.

                Do not buy if you think about service and warranty. I got it and had issued from the first month. I neglect to report it timely. I rented my house and my tenant started using it. They had the same problem. We called the service. They said there was a delay receiving hot water: we need to reset it. They charged me $120. In two weeks this time, they said motor is faulty and it is out of warranty. I decided to get rid of it and purchased a new dishwasher. They did not responded positively. I even told them to come and check if the machine has factory faulty. They said no. DO NOT BUY IT. I had a much better warranty experience with other companies.

                It is my first and last experience with KitchenAid. The order had been made on CyberMonday as a gift for Christmas to good friend. Amount had been charged from my CC, and in a week I receive an email from KitchenAid.com that my order is canceled. Link to order is not working, their site is under maintenance. There is NO way to reach Customer Service for order status. Horrible experience!!

                My wife finally decided to spend the money on an Artisan mixer. It came without the fill spout in the box. So I called the customer service number and was told the wait time was 39 minutes. Thinking this isn’t possible, I stayed on hold. After about 10 minutes I was told the wait time is still 33 minutes. I opted to use there email instead as I did not have time to sit on hold. I received a response that I would be contacted within 2 business days. After 3 go by with no communication, I call again. This time the wait was 11 minutes. I finally get a person and it was a harder process than expected.  Apparently someone else was registered with my phone number. We moved a year ago so maybe the old owner of our number did register. Understandable. But it confused the lady on the phone. She finally put me on hold for a while to look into something. When she returned, she took my information and they are supposed to be sending the part. We will see as it can take up to 10 business days. Which is also confusing as I could have just returned the unit as damaged instead of trying to save them the headache.

                I have a double Kitchen Aid oven and cook every day. Lower oven light bulb went out and when it was replaced it blew out all bulbs.  The repair man told me that the electric panel would need to be replaced , costing more than $1,000 and that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new oven.  Bear in mind that the ovens work perfectly, but what a joke and a rip off to need to spend over $1,000 to have lights in the ovens.   I would never buy another appliance from Kitchen Aid.  When I told our local dealer that I was going to try to have a reasonable conversation with Kitchen Aid about my dilemma, they said “ good luck”. That says it all!    Marilyn Smith, Dallas , Tx

                Bought a refrigerator and had to fix it twice in 3 years, being it in the same year within 6 months apart in a total of almost $1,200.00 and they basically said it was not under warranty and I would have to pay for everything. Will fix it, sell it and never ever buy any refrigerator from Kitchenaid.

                I purchased 3 major kitchen aide products during my kitchen remodel. I was encouraged to purchase these products because of a rebate kitchen aide was offering. 4 months later I still have no rebate and was told that although the items were purchased during the promotional period and paid for the delivered invoice was after the promotional period. If anyone has done a kitchen remodel you would know that installation can be delayed. I spent 8,000 on my appliances and Kitchen Aide will not pay me my 250$ rebate. I will never purchase another item from them again and will make sure I tell everyone I know what has happened . Very disappointed in this company

                Built a home 3 years ago and the builder put in Kitchen aid appliances. <br/><br/>First, the dishwasher doesn't dry ANYTHING!!!! The side vents are fake and the service guy admitted the product sucks ... HUH!?<br/><br/>Second, the fridge has a two doors, and one of them has a sealing panel attached to it, and when you open and close that door the other should close, but it doesn't, so unless you know this and close the other door two you wake up to pools of water on the floor and a half melted fridge!!! UGH!<br/><br/>Third, I was stupid enough to buy 3 under the counter fridges for wine, cocktail mixes, etc. HUGE mistake. After the first year one fo them had the=digtail control panel come UNGLUED!!! YES, THEY USE GLUE!!! After arguing with the service center they repaired it for free.<br/><br/>Guess what I just noticed? The second ones digital panel came unglued and the wine went bad.. smells horrible. Once again had to escalate the issue to Care Resolutoin and they said we will pay for the $5 part but I have to p[ay for service call... really? It's a completely flawed design with GLUE! And I'm sure the 3rd one will eventually lose it's tackiness. I'm mad as a hornet! 4 refrigerates that suck.. all for the low low price of $6,400!!! I'm such a sucker.. I HOPE YOU WON'T BE!! STAY AWAY FROM ALL KITEHCN AID CRAP!

                I chose to buy a Kitchenaid Dishwasher after my Maytag failed after 6.5 years.The dry cycle worked sporadically on the Maytag starting in year 5.On the brand new top of the line Kitchenaid it didnt work for a second.The dishwasher completed the cycle leaving the plates wet and utensils just wet.After emptying the dishwasher it remained wet and musty.Two weeks later the technician arrived to check why the Disheasher was not working.Surprise Surprise the 2 week old dishwasher needs a new motherboard I called Whirlpool..I told them I wasnt comfortable with a brand new dishwasher that needed major repair after 2 weeks..The Supervisor said if I didnt want the repairs offered she could help me by canceling the repair order as well..If you have never purchased a Kitchenaid Appliance dont..Lack of service and professionalism has been my first experience with them<br/><br/>.

                What a joke of a company, 15 days ago my 8 month old washing machine exploded shattering the glass door and ruining a wash load of clothes! They are no help whatsoever,won't send me a new machine despite it clearly been faulty but also don't have the parts to fix it.  Im an essential worker in a care home and can't even wash my clothes will never purchase this brand again.  Im totally demented have no idea how to get this resolved and can't afford to just go buy a new one!

                Faulty tumble dryer after 2 months, called first time to report and was told to pull it out and leave to sit for 30 minutes and call back if it didn't work. This was after being on hold for 38 minutes just to speak to someone. <br/><br/>... It didn't work. Called a second time and waited 28 minutes to speak to someone, was told to turn it off for 30 minutes to reset it and it would work... This didn't...<br/><br/>Called a third time today, still on hold waiting to speak to someone, currently on hold for 1 hour 8 minutes. Do they really call this customer service?

                Excellent service. The booking process was easy. I was advised of the time window in which the engineer would arrive. He actually arrived slightly before that window but that was not an issue. He worked for over an hour to fix the problem. Left everything clean and tidy and my washing machine working again! All whilst exercising social distancing. Great job! Thank you.

                I don’t recommend the Hoover  wash and dry washing machine because I bought a new machine and after a week she stop working they send me a engineer he came today he fixed and after one wash stop working again. Please be carful with this machine . I bought from Argos I try Event to call them but they didn’t answer at all and I pay 400£ and now again without a machine

                Excellent service despite covid circumstances. Telephone advisor was so helpful and reassuring and the washing machine engineer came prepared with his PPE mask and fresh new gloves for each visit, 2m apart and kindly advised me to wipe down any surfaces after he left. The engineer also called me beforehand his arrival advising indicated time and discussed potential issues and what he could realistically fix with his spare parts. He also fixed the washer in seconds.<br/>Only slight improvement I would suggest from Hoover would be receiving 2hour time slot text for engineer I was expecting that never arrived, but given current circumstances that's understandable and after a quick call to Hoover they were able tell me a rough estimate.

                I purchased a Hoover washing machine from AO.com at the end of March 2019. Model HBWD8514D-80. <br/>The function of the product was fine until yesterday when during a wash, the main drum seal tore. After speaking with customer service and then via the action desk - outlining the product was only weeks out of warranty, I was surprised to be told that the warranty had expired so I would need to pay £129 for a repair, or could purchase £200 of insurance for the next year. Now I understand a warranty is a contract on the terms of purchase, but you do hope a company would stand by the quality of their products with a little more authority. I couldn't recommend any white good of this sort that fails weeks beyond a 12 month guarantee with a minimum of £129 additional cost to be incurred.

                Came to fix their washing machine which has repeatedly broken to be fair with heavy use over the last few years. Last guy who came out could not put the washing back under units so now is left pulled out. I have chased for months with no call backs -  now they refuse to fix even though they caused the problem. I think avoid.

                I’d give it NO STARS or MINUS STARS if I could. This is the most useless and stupid cacophony of cheap plastic I have ever come across.

                When the engineer left there was no demonstration that the appliance had been fixed and when I went to try the appliance there was blood splatters on the rubber seal, the front/door , sides back and top of the appliance. When I had carefully cleaned this off and switched the appliance on, the grating, squealing noise was terrible. I contacted the help line who could only offer another engineer visit the following week.

                Put a call out for an engineer as the display kept lighting up and freezing (had to switch it off at the plug)  First engineer attended couldn’t do much as apparently he couldn’t connect to via the one touch facility due to updates being sent out he checked the electrics I showed him a picture on my phone. It carried on doing it so did a second call out the second engineer walked in I showed her what was happening. She straight away told me it was a setting for engineers to test the wash cycles. 🤦🏼‍♀️Surly the first guy could have told me that rather than waste a second appointment. I think some people need re training

                Service engineer was very professional and attempted to improve the machine, he told me to monitor the situation. Problem with the Hoover DHL Link washing machine has been worse ever since and it was only a month old when he came out. Absolutely the worst washing machine I have ever had in my many years of ownership, I am sticking to all the manual instructions (which frankly I did not have to with my old washing machine which lasted years). I am currently running this 9kg one on a half load programme (engineer recommended full, but honestly shakes so hard on a full cotton load it is scary to watch and listen to). He said the drum movement when the machine is not on was normal (it sways a bit), not sure I believe this based on my previous machines - if it is normal, it is a huge design flaw, the machine actually shakes and when on a high spin, the kitchen vibrates - not good!!!

He had travelled many miles to be with us which was a great relief to have the machine back up and running. It was under a 10 Yr guarantee but I needed to take out a 12 month Dom &amp; Gen cover which I had not budgeted for out of our 2 reduced pensions. 10 Yr guarantee would still have cost £129 to get repair done so it ended up a costly repair as I had chosen machine over other brands because of 10yr guarantee. Engineer helpful &amp; efficient.

                Service engineer was very professional and attempted to improve the machine, he told me to monitor the situation. Problem with the Hoover DHL Link washing machine has been worse ever since and it was only a month old when he came out. Absolutely the worst washing machine I have ever had in my many years of ownership, I am sticking to all the manual instructions (which frankly I did not have to with my old washing machine which lasted years). I am currently running this 9kg one on a half load programme (engineer recommended full, but honestly shakes so hard on a full cotton load it is scary to watch and listen to). He said the drum movement when the machine is not on was normal (it sways a bit), not sure I believe this based on my previous machines - if it is normal, it is a huge design flaw, the machine actually shakes and when on a high spin, the kitchen vibrates - not good!!!

                When our service visit was booked, we were asked if we would accept a service visit at short notice, as a cancellation or re-scheduling. <br/>Two days later, I received a phone call from the service engineer to ask if he could visit early the next day, sometime after 7.15. Sure enough, he arrived at 7.35 the next morning, before the text notifying me of the revised appointment time had reached my phone.<br/>The service engineer was punctual, efficient, pleasant  and polite. The washing machine was fixed very quickly, and there have been no problems since, so a very positive experience worth five stars.

                If I could leave 0 stars I would. I have never experienced anything like it. I totally appreciate the difficulties with the current Covid-19 situation, however, do you feel it is acceptable to leave a broken washing machine for 3 weeks? I have a 5 week old baby who I am unable to dress in clean clothes. I have a key working partner who has now been laid off due to being unable to attend work in clean uniform as this goes against their covid 19 policy.<br/>I am unable to use a laundrette as none are open and cannot visit elderly, vulnerable relatives to launder my clothes due to the risk of the virus.<br/>I have received a phone call from your engineer this morning explaining that she cannot come due to no part, however, the engineer last week told me it was in the warehouse ready. Explain that?<br/>Also, as mentioned previously, we are now financially being affected by this as my partner is not working as a result. <br/>Can I also mention that this is not an old washing machine, it was only 364 days old when it broke, yes, 1 day before the warranty ended...the drum has completely come off and sheared all the plastic inside. Good product?! I doubt it.<br/>I pay for domestic and general appliance insurance and they cannot help due to being within the manufactures warranty.<br/>I cannot wait for another repair and risk the same problem. <br/>For safety and hygiene reasons, I need a new machine. This is causing unnecessary stress to what is already a very difficult time to bring a new baby into a global pandemic.

                The 10yr Warranty is the biggest Con! You wait untill you buy your machine and register! It Costs A Fortune.<br/><br/>Problems - nearly 2yr old washing machine. Printed circuit board is buzzing and crackling and trips it out.<br/><br/>- 4 month old tumble dryer, make a huge thumping noise!! Was told that's normal. dries the second time it goes in, even if it's barely damp to begin with. Door latch is week and door easily pops open and stops the machine.<br/><br/>A year down the line we have 2 faulty appliances and the guarantee calls get pushed around. So I phone the number to call on the washing machine and tumble dryer, eventually get put through to someone at vacuums that can't help.<br/><br/>The idea of saving a few quid using HOOVER is a bad move... It's not worth it and will cost you more to keep

Have hoover changed the model of this mop as I had one for years before and never had this issue.

                The engineer turned up within the allocated time to repair our brand new unused HTDBW H7A1TCE Integrated Heat Pump Tumble Dryer. He identified the problem as three ridges on the front perimeter of the drum. He said that he thought this had been caused by the product being dropped in transit. He hammered out the drum ridges and made the machine a lot quieter but in the end Hoover decided to authorise a replacement. The replacement came and this had exactly the same problem but the control panel was not properly affixed to the machine and was loose. The retailer decided to replace the product this time and sent us another replacement. Dryer number 3 arrived and this had a sticker on the box saying ""Quality Checked"". This was the best of the three machines but still had kinks in the drum perimeter but was less noisy than the previous two machines. We have decided to keep this machine as it is such an inconvenience having the machine replaced. It would appear that the quality control and the build quality is the real problem with this model. As for the dryer itself, if you can get a good build it is a really good machine and the hoover service engineer was really good and quick to attend.

It had never worked properly and the engineer declared the control panel defective within minutes of arriving. So, Engineer = excellent, but Hoover Tumble dryer = £500 wasted (chosen for its alleged WiFi capability to extend drying cycles remotely but, like the machine itself, simply does not work).<br/><br/>If you like to be bitterly disappointed and to waste your hard-earned money, then this could be just the tumble dryer you are looking for.

                Just had an Engineer out to replace the drum on my tumble dryer, when he had finished he told me he couldn't take the old drum away and just left this huge drum in the middle of the ktchen floor. Can you tell me where in the Terms and Conditions it states that the disposal of replaced parts is my responsibility? I have checked the the Terms and Conditions and i can't see that anywhere, I am now going to have to pay someone to collect this hugh drum and that is unfair.

                The Hoover Dynamic Next Washer Dryer is an incredibly unreliable appliance. When you buy a washing machine you expect it to be the back bone of your house, an appliance you can count on to keep you at your best. Previous washing machines I have had have given me 10 years of service with out problems. This one unfortunately comes with what feels like a subscription repair service amounting to about 100 euro a year. In just under two years this washing machine has turned from a 400 euro machine into a 600 euro machine and I can only assume the cost will rise as the years go on. After multiple costly breakdowns Hoover have not accepted that it is a fault in the individual machine and offered to replace it therefore I can only assume it is a fault in the line as a whole line. Do Not Buy. I will be cutting my losses and looking for something else.

                Terrible customer service and products.<br/>I have a dynamic Hoover washer/dryer. - Do not buy!<br/>First off the dryer function has never worked properly- Low temp doesn't dry even with minimal clothes in it &amp; high temps scorch and shrinks clothes. I forgave that knowing washer/dryers aren't perfect and its a waste of electricity anyway so wouldn't want to be using all the time.<br/>Then it started making noises which got progressively louder over a few washes, an error message came up and stopped the machine from working. I called the retailer and they contacted hoover to send an engineer out at no cost to me. Engineer came out and was to be fair very quick and clean repairing the issue which was loose bolts holding the drum in place. <br/>Now 5 months after the first repair the washing machine started to make an almighty banging sound (louder than ever before with loose bolts) midway into a wash. This time no error message came up and it continued to stay on causing more damage as it spun around. I had to turn off the machine by hand once it was noticed. This is the part that worried me the most. Once I opened the door (after it unlocked) you could clearly see the drum had fallen out of place and the rubber on the edges had started to come off in some sections. <br/>My issue here is that the machine had no auto turn off system after the entire drum had fallen out of place with water still in it and the electrics still running which in my mind is a fire hazard if it had a chance to flood. I do not feel comfortable repairing the same machine again and would only expect a full replacement especially as this is not the first time I've had an issue with the machine. I explained this all to a Hoover customer service rep who said I would have to pay for the repair this time. I said that was not acceptable and she said there was nothing Hoover could do except get me to pay for the repair. I said this issue is clearly on going and more dangerous and severe than last time. She then said ""well it has worked for the 5 months after the repair work so there's nothing else we can do"". I would have no problem paying for repair if it was a completely separate issue, but it is the same drum issue but much more serve and dangerous now as the machine didn't auto turn off this time. I have lost all confidence with this hoover machine.<br/><br/>EDIT- They do not respond to the email outlined below. It seems like the response below is just for show. I'm going to move to another brand such as BOSCH as they have a much longer warranty and reviews look overall better. I hope this helps other consumers out there.

                ORDER ONLINE AT YOUR PERIL.<br/>The website says UK, the website is in English.  However once you order you become captive audience.  Hoover is a front for third party companies and deliveries based in Italy and the finance link is to another third party company.  The wheels of delivery move very slowly as they now have your money and only then do they say the item is being delivered from Italy.  I rang there HOOVER hotline only to be told to email the third party company in Italy.  They lack transparency on their website, makes you wonder how good their products are.

                I purchased my Hoover Dynamic Next 8kg washer dry from John Lewis last year.<br/><br/>From day one the drying function was over heating and scorching my clothes, in addition to excessive vibration (had multiple machines in its place prior not making noise, flat floor, 'perfect' for washing machine to go on) it pulled my cupboards away from counter and vibrated shelf off the wall caused damage to lots of crockery, broken glasses and the cost of a handy man to re hang my shelf.<br/><br/>I called the call centre who were not helpful and asked me to speak to John Lewis, I then called Hoover back as Joh Lewis said the repairs are nothing to do with them.<br/><br/>The repair man came who said there was nothing wrong with it and told me how all machines these days are cheap and have a spring loaded mechanism with cause them to vibrate also. I explained how upset I was, he told me to call the call center and 'threaten them with social media 'n' all that' for your money back. He did a test on his phone and showed me there were no errors, i tried to explain how why a machine would tell him it is faulty when it thinks it is performing correctly, he didn’t have a reply. I was never informed of a charge and was subsequently charged £65.00 for this visit.<br/><br/>I was them visited by the area manager, who said there was nothing wrong with the machine but proceeded to replace the thermostat and motherboard.<br/><br/>Once this was fitted it worked perfectly for 3 washed until another issue which only happened sometimes since day one then happened each and every time, whenever it would get to 3 minutes it would increase the time, fill up and spin again. It repeated to do this for 3 hours! when i realized it was clearly a fault and turned off the machine. Although I was assured I would not be billed for any of the visits, I then received another bill for £65 which I had to phone up and spend an hour on the phone sorting.<br/><br/>The repair man came out, the same one as the first time despite telling the call centre I felt threatened when he was in my home. He did a test on his phone to which he said it was 'done in' called a lady on the phone and said 'i was doing really well today wasn't I' he left my house without saying goodbye and didn't remove his aviator sunglasses the entire time. I think he might have hated me because I complained about him perhaps.<br/><br/>A different repair man came to fir a new motherboard, he managed to fit and test it in 15 minutes which is either efficient or slap dash but he was very friendly.<br/><br/>Since 3 days ago when it was 'fixed' the machine gets to 11 minutes, then increases the time to 16 minutes, fills, drains then spins. This was repeated 13 times over the course of an hour or so before i turned it off. The spin and drain function gets to one minute and continuously spins faster and faster and broke my kitchen cabinets I had previously paid to be fixed due to this machine. The vibration has returned to being as bad as when I first got it, as if the machines sensor for weight it broken as I was told by the manager who came to fix to only use the long wash cycles as the fast ones just spin regardless. I have followed this advice since.<br/><br/>I sincerely think my washing machine is not fit for purpose. I called Hoover today in tears and spoke to a really nice lady called Nicky who is forwarding my issue to the 'Resolutions Team' who will be in touch sometime next week.<br/><br/>I am disabled and receive PIP payments of which I saved up to buy this machine, since receiving this machine I have not had one successful wash and have taken to washing my clothes in the bath as I am frightened of it. Since buying this machine, I have had to spend my disability payments on getting my laundry done with had amounted to around £112 a month to which I receive about £200 a month in PIP payments. I have told Hoover this many times but there is no empathy. The lino in the kitchen is torn badly from being dragged out so many times, landlord will make me pay for this.<br/><br/>***UPDATE***<br/>Since then I have received emails asking me to confirm yet another engineer appointment to which they have confirmed I might be liable for a further fee.<br/><br/>I have then asked to speak to the customer resolutions team as promised on the phone AND IN THE MESSAGE FROM HOOVER BELOW however I was told that this was not possible and I have to call the main line to which they 'may' be able to transfer me Peter from Hoover states.<br/><br/>I have since asked for him to find out the case handler in that team and ask them to call me directly or email me with a number to call them straight back on if they do not currently have the facility.<br/><br/>My situation isn't being sorted out at all and they are just pushing me around in circles yet again.<br/><br/>I have now contacted the CEO and partners of John Lewis and Hoover to await a response

                Good prompt service from Hoover engineer. The only thing I’d say is that he moaned about lack of lighting in my utility room. A couple of bulbs had gone and in the current situation hadn’t had a chance to replace them. He mentioned the lighting a few times, which was unnecessary and unprofessional. Let’s be honest he could have used a torch.

                I have owned Hoover washing machines since I left the comfort of my parents house in 1981. The first machine lasted 25 years, brilliant machine. My next Hoover only lasted 13 years, still good in my opinion. Alas my latest one, a 9kg Link is very disappointing. The daily 59 programme, the one I used most on the old machine is strange. On a 30 degrees wash the clothes come out warm (I have only the cold feed connected). This indicates to me that they arent being rinsed enough, so I have to put them on a extra rinse and spin at the end of the programme. The machine sometimes bounces all over the floor when on spin, despite me trying different size loads. This means I dare not leave the room until the wash is finished. And to top it all off the time remaining indicator is unreliable, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes disappears without reason.<br/>It will be interesting to see how long this machine lasts, providing I dont hit it with the hammer in frustration.

                Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. I’ve never been treated that bad before. An engineer came to see my washing machine and tell me what’s the problem, I ordered a broken part through him, payed £129 for it to the engineer who told me the prt will arrive in 5 working days. One and a half month later the part still hasn’t arrived, and every time I call them they pass me from one person to another and nobody knows where my part is. They are all rude, and they offered me a 50% refund after one and a half month of waiting !<br/>I’ll throw away their useless machine and go buy a product from a decent company.

                Hoover have responded, not very helpfully, to my review and have referred me to the retailer!  Bearing in mind this is a Hoover products why should the retailer (Curry's) have to bear the brunt.<br/><br/>I recently bought a Hoover Optimum Power Allergy &amp; Pets OP30ALG - 001- 39001622 and I can say it is possibly the worst piece of kit I've ever had the misfortune to use.  It has absolutely no suction power whatsoever, it rolls rolls hair and fluff backwards and forwards without ever picking it up (it has a 'Pet Hair' attachment which is also laughable).  Even on linoleum and hardwood floors it struggles and I've reverted to a broom until my new vacuum cleaner arrives!  I've persevered with it but am absolutely furious that this could be sold in Curry's as a sensible piece of electrical equipment - it's an absolute joke and I'm not sure what the hell Hoover engineers were thinking of.  I'd like to take it back to Curry's but in the present circumstances this is not going to be possible and by the time we're allowed out again I will no doubt be told that i should have returned it sooner!

                I am 100000% certain these r refurbished machines in no way is it possible for a machine to break down so quickly. I’ve  had my fair share of budget Washing machines over the years But I have never encountered this many problems with one company/machine  it’s not even been two washes since I begged them to give me a replacement after the first one broke down after maybe 5 washes and now it’s not working it’s just not working. In all the budget washing machines I’ve purchased I’ve never ever had one break down. If a review is ever worth trusting this is the review that will save you money, time and will save you from having a mental breakdown. Stay far away from hoover

                Happy with repair, but he left machine on an uneven surface, so wobbled and the machine could not be put on as it wouldn’t spin properly.   I had to get my son to help me to try and move it back. <br/><br/>Made no attempt at just wiping it, or showing it any care or attention, just did bare minimum.   Left box with old bit from machine, so I had to dispose of that.   <br/><br/>Said to my son they wouldn’t come out  if we didn’t clean the filter, but didn’t show us how to, or even know if he did. <br/><br/>He didn’t check the machine as he would have noticed the door lock doesn’t work either, but that wasn’t repaired. <br/><br/>Thank you for the repair, but not very thorough.

                The engineer came and replaced the hose, but left the machine with a different error.  He could not come back same day as he was too busy so I had another appointment arranged, but that engineer could not come as he was unable to work due to the COVID crisis.  I gave up at that point and purchased another washing machine - Not a Hoover.

                This is the noisiest appliance ever. We have a fridge/freezer, dishwasher, and two other fridges ALL of which are silent by comparison. I asked about the fan noise soon after I bought it and was told it was perfectly normal. Well, as this replaced an almost identical looking wine fridge branded Capel which was silent, I was extremely disappointed. Surely you could manufacture this with a silent or near silent fan? Others can obviously do it and I thought the Hoover brand name would be first class and the highest quality but this is just cheap and not very good at all.

                Hoover Dynamic Next A*** model DXOA 68C3/1-80 only 1 year and 4 months old, household of 2 so not heavily used. Today new motor and board. Now an hour later won't complete a spin even when loaded up. First Hoover washer I've bought, with insurance this now costing well over 500.00 for 2 years, not worth it. Disappointed as I thought I was buying a good product. Engineer can't come til next week so in effect got no washer for over 2 weeks.<br/><br/>Things got worse. New replacement washer through their insurance arrived but due to COVID-19, it couldn't be fitted by delivery team. I managed to do that, it's a Hoover AXI A*** 9 KGS.  The LED display can only be seen in the dark so rang them to explain I couldn't make out what program it was on at all and was this the way it was supposed to be. Agreed to send an engineer who now has ordered parts so that LED display can be seen. Don't know how or when it will be sorted out. Set the wash program in the dark, the machine seems to work fine.

                Whilst the second engineer gave me a lot more info on the machine I was shocked that the advertising on the machine which led to the purchase has proved to be so misleading. The machine was described as 9kg, 1600 spin with a 59 minute programme. However the 1600 spin and 9kg washes are for 4 white programmes only of 205 minutes minimum , and the rest are 2.5 -.4.5kgs only and a maximum 1200 spin and I have to constantly use the spin programme on top to get it dry enough. Very much not the machine I thought I was buying and the first ever to not add up to worth the money! I will be telling everyone I know what a poor machine I have purchased !

                I’ve been very dissatisfied with my entire experience of buying a washer drier from hoover. It was purchased just over a year ago on 31st December 2018. We only had it three months when it stopped drying the clothes. When my husband called to get an engineer out we were told we should be paying for insurance in case there was any damage to the machine, otherwise we would get charged for the repair, we were advised that dog hair in the machine would be considered damage and since we have two dogs we found it impossible that there would be no dog hair in the machine and thought it best to take the insurance.  We have subsequently found out that this advise was not accurate, and when my husband had asked in a later phone call was met with an abrupt reply of “nobody forced you to take the insurance”. The machine has broken a subsequent three times since the first time, each time the same engineer attended.  At one point we were advised that the machine needed a part replaced, which was quite disappointing after only having it for a few months. The machine had broken down at the start of February for the 4th time and after having another call out from the same engineer he advised he was going to ask for a replacement machine, that we would get a telephone call within the next couple of days and a new machine within a week. By the end of the week we had heard nothing. My husband had called again to be told that the request for replacement had been escalated as the replacement team did not think a replacement was necessary and did not trust the engineers judgement(I don’t know why they don’t believe their engineers) however nobody had thought to contact us about it. They replacement team only had two of the four repairs on the system and it apparently was quite a task resolving the issue. It took several phone calls and over two weeks to finally be told that there was nothing could be done and a replacement was indeed necessary. All the while we still have a broken machine. We were told that we could go onto the hoover website to pick a new machine of the same spec, and a link was sent via email. The link had only one machine of the same spec but when we looked on the website there was another machine we liked better. We called to ask if we could have this instead (and we were willing to pay an upgrade fee) to be told it was out of stock and that we were to take the machine from the email link. We are also to pay £9.60 for the removal of the machine and £14 for installation, if we did not pay the removal fee they were just going to leave us with two machines. Apparently good customer service is not at the forefront but gouging money out of people is. I was hoping to keep my machine for years but in all honesty I think as soon as I’ve saved for a new machine I will buy one from a different company and see the back of Hoover permanently.

                We have just had a Hoover engineer named John Morris attend our house to fix a fault with our Washing machine and I have to say what a brilliant job he has done.

                Making the booking was easy.after listening to the sales pitch to take out a D&amp;G insurance policy-Weeks old and Hoover don't have that confidence in their product? He arrived on time - he had  prior contacted me with his eta. Told him the problem and acted as if he did now know the cause, but he knew and changed the C/Board.. He was very polite and new his job.

                Bought Hoover Tumbledryer 10 weeks ago. Phoned on Monday under guarantee. First appointment on Friday. Drum on Tumbledryer has a tear on it. Hoover will not replace machine but will supply a new drum. What they Don't tell you it's 5 days lead time for new parts. What a joke. So 10 weeks old and can't use appliance for nearly 2 weeks. Not the type of service I expect from any company. Think carefully before you buy Hoover/Candy<br/>.

                Compact and attractively made, this appliance fit well into my kitchen.   Its controls are adequate although generally rather small for my aging eyes.   I found the ""Crust Colour"" indicator particularly difficult to see.  The way several features are indicated on one screen is sometimes confusing.   <br/>.   I read through the instructions and I came to the actual recipes.  This was what it was all about!    I followed the basic bread instructions meticulously; and started the programme.   In use the Bread-Maker was very good; no undue noise or vibration. The only smell emitted was delightful.   However, the final result almost cracked my worktop when i tipped it out; my loaf was like a house-brick   I turned to the back of the Manual for error messages and, turning the pages, happened to see a comment telling me to use WARM water!!   If only this had been mentioned in the earlier part.<br/>Since then my only failure was when I used yeast whose ""best before date"" was 2013.   Seeded bread and Wholewheat bread  worked well;  my next adventure will be Gluten-free.<br/>The Display Panel is rather cramped - I have difficulty seeing the indicator for Crust.   Some revision of the Manual would be appreciated.   However,I think I have value for money. <br/><br/>.

                The engineer, a chap from Bury St.Edmunds was excellent, 5 out of 5. But we needed a return visit and to have to wait a week for that was unacceptable.<br/>Fortunately there are just two of us. A family with children would have had problems. Must do better!!

                Hoover themselves were very remiss as they had said that they would put a note on the system to let the repairer know that I would be home from work at 11.15, the DID’NT.  Luckily for me I arrived just as he was about to leave, that is why the one less star.<br/><br/>Right as for the repairer he was brilliant, friendly, helpful and of course sorted out my machine, so he has all of the 4 stars and if it was just him he would have 5 stars.

                The customer service here was fantastic and arranged for an engineer to be out within a week after taking all the details. When the engineer arrived, on time, he knew exactly what rhe problem was and made the repair in no time at all and even gave us advice on having the unit under the work surface and gain sufficient air flow. All in all fantastic service from start to finish.

                Engineer was polite and respectful.  He listened to what I had to say about the problems with the washing machine and then performed tests to check the systems. <br/>The motor was replaced and retested but without any clothes and although it sounds better since using the machine, the whirring sound has began again when clothes are washing.  At this stage I will continue to use the machine, hoping that the motor will bed in and become quite and stop the whirring sound when spinning.

                Extremely disappointed with their customer service. My washing machine had a fault after 6 months, a very simple fix (the part on their website is £13). I called to make an engineer appointment on 23rd February. They passed me over to third party who has mucked about wanting to order new doors etc. After 2 weeks of no one even attending my property to even look at the fault I called again and they said they would send one of their engineers out instead. No one turned up and apparently I’ve now been put back to this other company and they will come out to assess the fault on the 19th March. That’s if they even turn up. The person on the phone said they can’t help me I’ve got to call the other company. Useless!

I phoned hoover who sent an engineer out who inspected the m/c, he said he could find no faults but said it was much noisier than he would expect but he could do nothing about it as he could not find any fault causing the noise and i would need to phone hoover. When i phoned them they said they would take no further action as the engineers report said no fault was found. Without going into detail the shop where i bought the m/c came and inspected the m/c and agreed the noise was totally unacceptable and replaced the m/c with a different make. Hoover were no help whatsoever in fact i would say they disowned me and any responsibility for supplying a faulty m/c. I personally will never ever purchase any hoover equipment again.

                Never again!! <br/>Against my better judgement, I purchased a candy tumble dryer 4 months ago.  It's been broken for the past 6 weeks &amp; on the blink longg before that.   Hoover sent an engineer out twice in the same week... changed a circuit board &amp; then a door seal... &amp; it's still not working properly.  So I contacted customer service &amp; they pushed it to a resolution team... who resolved nothing.  After not hearing back for 10 days, despite a promise of a resolution decision in 5 days, I contacted them again.  I was told an engineer should have contacted me... but strangely asked what was the issue with the machine!??  My head is hurting by now.... and then because I won't clear my work diary (for the 3rd time) to accommodate an engineer at any time of day... and they can't even narrow it down to a half day... it's going to be a further 3 weeks until someone can come.  Call me awkward... but what kind of customer service is that??? It's not my fault your product  is faulty.. so why am I the only one in this that needs to flexible??  <br/><br/>I will never again purchase from this ridiculous company... I was warned against it,  but couldn't imagine anyone being this bad. <br/><br/>Be warned

                My partner and I moved into our new apartment in November 2018 and we had a company fit a brand new fitted kitchen costing over €5000 which included a hoover fridge-freezer and a candy oven along with a dishwasher. The company fitted and supplied all the appliances and we hoped that would be that. Little did we know that both the oven and the fridge would not work properly and cause us considerably trouble in trying to fix.<br/><br/>We rang your call centre in the first week of November 2019 and the lady said it was a few days over warranty but as a measure of goodwill that hoover would cover the cost of repairing them. An engineer Ciaran,eventually came out a few weeks later to try to fix the oven. Sadly all he did was tighten a few screws and we had to see would this work. This fix didn't work and he had to call out another few weeks later to try and fix it again. This again didn't work and I had to get him out a third time where he replaced the oven motor. I had told him to look at fridge during these visits but he insisted that it would have to be done another time as he would have to email hoover to get go ahead. Eventually he came in early January and said the fridge-freezer was not worth repairing as it was ""economically unviable to do so as the condenser wasn't working right"". He said he would sign off on this and that hoover would be in contact to replace the fridge-freezer.<br/><br/>Well I'm sick of waiting so I rang Ciaran the engineer today and he said hoover  should have gotten back to us. He gave me the telephone number in the U.K. and a job reference number: 16759442 and I was speaking to a guy called John who said we would have to pay €150 to get a new fridge freezer. He then went on to say I would have to get the invoice from the third party company who fitted the kitchen and email it to ye and it will be reviewed.  At this stage I'm totally sick of being passed from pillar to post and getting nowhere. Clearly the oven and the fridge were not fit for purpose and under the Supply of Goods and services act 1980, they are clearly not fit for purpose.  As I write this I'm listening to the fridge make an awful noise and I'm sick of it at this stage. I can't afford to pay out more money and I'm getting increasingly frustrated. <br/><br/>I'll never again buy or recommend anyone to buy hoover or candy products as they clearly are sub standard. Out of the 3 appliances in our new kitchen, 2 out of three were defective. It's not a good advertisement for reliable products is it..........I would say AVOID!!!!!

                Before I go on, AO have been amazing, Hoover are the ones that have been naff. <br/><br/>From new, it has had three washes. The first was to rinse it out before use. The second, the clothes came out warm and not smelling of detergent or conditioner meaning it at least didn't get a cold rinse and possibly never had the powder washed into the load. <br/><br/>The third wash on a baby cycle which was only a third full stopped half way through and returned an error code of E08. For some BIZARRE reason the code is not listed in the user manual. I tried to download the android software which only has a 1 star from the Play Store and couldn't get it. Google tells me it is a motor fault. <br/><br/>The machine does seem louder than we are used to but it does mention in the spec that comparatively, it is a noisier machine.  <br/><br/>Phoned Hoover, they confirmed the error code and blamed it on being under loaded and asked me if I wanted an engineer visit which I might have to pay for depending on what the engineer says despite the error code clearly showing a machine fault. Hoover rep was not helpful, didn't know squat about washing machines, ignored what I told her and talked to me like I was stupid e.g. was it plumbed in correctly! Is there anyone who could not screw a water hose on and plug it in? <br/><br/>Rang AO, the guy was excellent, knew loads about washing machines, he considered the whole situation by listening to my facts and incorporating the age of the machine, how we had used it etc and concluded it was more likely a serious fault over user error. As it had been reported straight away he decided to swap the machine for another at the first opportunity. No cost, no risk, just minor inconvenience at having to plumb in another machine and get rid of the packaging. <br/><br/>HOOVER, DONT TALK TO ME LIKE I AM A CHILD.

                6th engineer visit in first 10 months of owning tumble dryer, plug melted and still no response from escalations!!!<br/>I am absolutely appalled at the Customer Service received from Hoover Candy.  The majority of first line staff have agreed with me but all they can do is pass the details on to escalations and I never hear back.  Had Tumble Dryer 10 months, on my 6th call out from local company as due to staff sickness there are no engineers in my area.  Still without a working tumble dryer.  On last visit even had to replace the power lead as plug had melted and cracked my electrical socket!! Replaced second thermostat within 3 weeks and still not staying on so have no idea what to do next.  Feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.  Never had such poor service ever.

                Never again!! <br/>Against my better judgement, I purchased a candy tumble dryer 4 months ago.  It's been broken for the past 6 weeks &amp; on the blink longg before that.   Hoover sent an engineer out twice in the same week... changed a circuit board &amp; then a door seal... &amp; it's still not working properly.  So I contacted customer service &amp; they pushed it to a resolution team... who resolved nothing.  After not hearing back for 10 days, despite a promise of a resolution decision in 5 days, I contacted them again.  I was told an engineer should have contacted me... but strangely asked what was the issue with the machine!??  My head is hurting by now.... and then because I won't clear my work diary (for the 3rd time) to accommodate an engineer at any time of day... and they can't even narrow it down to a half day... it's going to be a further 3 weeks until someone can come.  Call me awkward... but what kind of customer service is that??? It's not my fault your product  is faulty.. so why am I the only one in this that needs to flexible??  <br/><br/>I will never again purchase from this ridiculous company... I was warned against it,  but couldn't imagine anyone being this bad. <br/><br/>Be warned

                On purchasing a Hoover Double Oven in October 2019, was initially happy with the product.. However,  we have now been without a working oven for 26 days  - we have had 2 visits from the engineer, none of which solved the problem, we were informed they have 28 days to solve this - but here we are 26 days in with no response &amp; no oven &amp; absolutely no feedback or communication, to say we are appalled is an understatement. All of the communication we have had has been us chasing them for a response, even to the point , that we were told to pick another oven, went to collect it &amp; the person knew nothing about what we were asking.. You could not make this up.. I will never buy another of their products.. &amp; please do us all a favour &amp; take a refresher  course in customer services.. The money it has cost to hire a van to pick up the new oven (which then did not exist!) We are living on sandwiches &amp; tinned products, but all Hoover had to say was ""we have 28 days""... not the fact that they could have helped straight away (very defensive) ... A letter has been sent to your Chief Exec. The only positive out of this was the engineer who came to the house, who did everything possible to help us &amp; even then Hoover disbelieved him!!!!

                DHL 1482D3/1-80 8kg 1400.  Avoid avoid avoid. Also avoid because of customer services unless you want to be royally ripped of.  Machine flooded kitchen after six weeks. After twelve weeks it burnt towels and smelled my house out. It carried on doing both three times over the next nine months.  Engineer came last time and said he had fixed the leak. Within just half an hour it was leaking from the exact same spot so I sent a picture to hoover who said there was no fault when the engineer came. Pardon me !!  Their area manager told me their machines can’t take more than three towels in a single wash and that’s why I had dirty marks as I overloaded. Not dirty marks, burns the smells was awful in my whole house.  Three towels in an 8kg machine !,  Insulting to their own machine that excuse is !,  It’s so noisy it’s like a pneumatic drill, if it’s not tucked away under counters it actually travels across your floor bashing into things. I know as it’s been out in the middle of my kitchen recently, cos of a leak, and it ended up moving and hitting hell into my radiator on spin, it’s vicious. I’ve never had an error code for any fault I’ve had so obviously their mother board isn’t showing any to them, Probably yet another fault of the stupid machine. I’m left with an unusable leaking machine that you can’t wash more than a quarter of a load and you can’t use more than a 40 degree wash or it may burn your clothes and is leaking all over my floor so I have to disconnect the water supply after each use.   The detergent draw won’t open the same time as the door is open and it holds water so is permanently smelly and filthy.  I paid my own plumber to look at the leak and he was disgusted it was left like that and located the issue within two mins. Disgraceful machine. Disgraceful customer service.  They want your cash but then do not care for your safety.  Buy at your own risk. As not 14 months later I don’t have a properly working machine and hoover care not one jot.  Last engineer call out he fixed the leak (he said).  As he didn’t I sent a picture and I was told there wasn’t a fault and I’m entitled to nothing else.   Pardon me !!!!!   It wasnt fixed !!!!  Six call outs in less than a year, burns, floods, (plural) and all I get is a plethora of excuses, mainly that the computer says there’s no fault.  Well my eyes tell me otherwise as does my nose as does my floor and my mop.  A joke of a not fit for purpose machine and a joke of a not fit for purpose company.

A letter has been sent to your Chief Exec. The only positive out of this was the engineer who came to the house, who did everything possible to help us &amp; even then Hoover disbelieved him!!!!

                Bought £180 worth of cordless vacuum on Christmas eve 2019, very pleased with the vacuum cleaner.<br/><br/>Went to charge the battery last week and dropped the plug onto a soft carpeted floor, the black/negative pin snapped off, rendering the charger useless.<br/><br/>Over the years I've owned many appliances with similar plugs, all robust enough to outlive the appliance, they're obviously using cheap materials to save money now, so beware.<br/><br/>I emailed Hoover to see if they would/could help, they didn't want to know/weren't interested.<br/><br/>I now have a useless vacuum!!!!!!<br/><br/>Luckily I kept my old Henry, 15 years old and still going strong, more than I can say for Hoover, two months old and useless!!!!!<br/><br/>THEY EVEN EMPLOY PEOPLE TO REPLY TO REVIEWS AND WASTE MORE OF MY TIME BY ANSWERING IN THE FALSE HOPE OF A POSITIVE SOLUTION, ONLY TO GET A DON'T WANT TO KNOW/DON'T CARE ATTITUDE FROM THEM -- AGAIN. <br/><br/>I REITERATE, HOOVER PRODUCTS ARE A LOAD OF RUBBISH, DO NOT TOUCH WITH A BARGE POLE!!<br/><br/>FURTHER CAVEAT, NO LUCK/HELP FROM HOOVER,<br/>QUOTED £17.50 FOR NEW PLUG, HA, £11.50 FROM E-BAY, SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT RUBBISH COMPANY, COMPLETE RIP-OFF !!!!!!!!!

                DHL 1482D3/1-80 8kg 1400.  Avoid avoid avoid. Also avoid because of customer services unless you want to be royally ripped of.  Machine flooded kitchen after six weeks. After twelve weeks it burnt towels and smelled my house out. It carried on doing both three times over the next nine months.  Engineer came last time and said he had fixed the leak. Within just half an hour it was leaking from the exact same spot so I sent a picture to hoover who said there was no fault when the engineer came. Pardon me !!  Their area manager told me their machines can’t take more than three towels in a single wash and that’s why I had dirty marks as I overloaded. Not dirty marks, burns the smells was awful in my whole house.  Three towels in an 8kg machine !,  Insulting to their own machine that excuse is !,  It’s so noisy it’s like a pneumatic drill, if it’s not tucked away under counters it actually travels across your floor bashing into things. I know as it’s been out in the middle of my kitchen recently, cos of a leak, and it ended up moving and hitting hell into my radiator on spin, it’s vicious. I’ve never had an error code for any fault I’ve had so obviously their mother board isn’t showing any to them, Probably yet another fault of the stupid machine. I’m left with an unusable leaking machine that you can’t wash more than a quarter of a load and you can’t use more than a 40 degree wash or it may burn your clothes and is leaking all over my floor so I have to disconnect the water supply after each use.   The detergent draw won’t open the same time as the door is open and it holds water so is permanently smelly and filthy.  I paid my own plumber to look at the leak and he was disgusted it was left like that and located the issue within two mins. Disgraceful machine. Disgraceful customer service.  They want your cash but then do not care for your safety.  Buy at your own risk. As not 14 months later I don’t have a properly working machine and hoover care not one jot.  Last engineer call out he fixed the leak (he said).  As he didn’t I sent a picture and I was told there wasn’t a fault and I’m entitled to nothing else.   Pardon me !!!!!   It wasnt fixed !!!!  Six call outs in less than a year, burns, floods, (plural) and all I get is a plethora of excuses, mainly that the computer says there’s no fault.  Well my eyes tell me otherwise as does my nose as does my floor and my mop.  A joke of a not fit for purpose machine and a joke of a not fit for purpose company.

                I had an issue with my washing machine not that long after installation.  I spoke with their support team who from the very start provided me with exceptional service.  <br/>After a long discussion, and a few laughs, I did end up taking out the monthly insurance (which i never normally do) I'm just thankful for the peace of mind should anything happen in the future.<br/>When the engineer came out to repair my washing machine, he very kindly helped remove my plinths to pull the machine out. Within 10 minutes he had diagnosed and replaced a faulty motor, plus, again, helping me put the plinths back in place.<br/>From start to finish, I cannot fault this service.<br/>Thank you so much.

                If you're unemployed and like sitting at home all day then this is the company for you.<br/>My washing machine is 2 years old, the programme selector started to fail.  I took a day off work , because they cannot give you any guidance on when they will arrive until that morning........who thinks that's acceptable?  Engineer 'fixed' the issue, 3 months later the same problem, another day off work but this time the engineer was ill.  When I called to rescehedule I was expected to take another day off.  I told them I had no more annual leave left but they refused to assure me a first call of the day.  So next date booked, whether the engineer arrives for the 8.30 slot I have no idea. Oh, and they don't work Saturdays unless overtime is required.  Polite staff but couldn't have been less helpful if they'd tried.<br/>NEVER buy a Hoover Candy product, buyer beware.

                Purchased a washer dryer in September 2019, on 2nd February it made a loud bang and fused my kitchen.  I have been told they won't replace it without trying to repair it even though the parts outweigh the replacement cost.  I am now on day 29 with 3 young children and no washer dryer because it is still waiting for parts which have no eta and they are still refusing to offer me a replacement.  Absolutely disgusting customer service

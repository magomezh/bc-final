                My girlfriend made an online order for us. She drove out to the IKEA Taastrup where we ordered from and was told our order had been cancelled, recreated and cancelled again (I suspect a member of staff didn't fancy picking so many items) my partner asked how this was possible as the only information she had received was an order confirmation and instructions for us to go and collect our order.<br/><br/>She came home empty handed. After chatting to web chat she was instructed to call customer services. Customer services told her after a lengthy call that they had agreed for our order to be picked with the store and we could collect it after the next day. We have a newborn baby and were in the middle of moving so our time is limited and we were counting quite heavily on getting the curtains from our order to help put the baby down to sleep in the dark.<br/><br/>We also specifically chose online picking to avoid crowds (due to the virus) and to save time.<br/><br/>Next it was my turn. I drove again to IKEA early on Sunday morning to collect our order and made sure I arrived early enough (09:40) to be the 2nd car waiting outside the collection point. <br/><br/>IKEA staff came strolling out of the building around 10:15 and began dealing with the first car at least 20 mins after the supposed opening time. When it was my turn I was asked to wait in bay 1. I did so and after 10 minutes I was told very quickly through my car window that I needed to go to the returns section of the store to collect my order, and they had nothing to do with it (even though 10 minutes earlier they took the code customer services gave to my gf for our newly recreated order). At this point I was beginning to get very frustrated, it was weekend and the number of cars in the parking lot indicated there would be a lengthy queue.<br/><br/>The returns section was cordoned off due to the virus and I could see that only 1 or 2 people were being allowed down into the returns section at a time. I explained to the member of staff on the door my situation. This was the only member of staff of the 10 that I, or my partner dealt with who showed any real empathy to my story and situation. He let me go down, avoiding a queue that looked like it would take at least 45 minutes to get through.<br/><br/>Downstairs I spent 30-40 minutes with an angry, uninformative member of staff who made phone call after phone call. Always out of hearing distance for me and who told me multiple times ""it's busy""""you will have to pick your order yourself"" ""I don't know where your order is"". It was quite clear once I was asked to leave the collection point that my order had never been picked.<br/><br/>When you pay for a service you expect it to be delivered and if not at least a satisfactory answer to why what should be a standard business practice of order picking could go so wrong. If you're staff had any proper training then a simple apology, explanation of the error and some form of compensation would have kept me a happy customer. Instead her and others lack of empathy and desire to take responsibility to do this only fuelled my frustration more. I can see now that I am not the only one who has received such a shocking level of service so it is clear IKEAs promise to pick and deliver orders for such a low fee clearly backfired and fatigue set in for staff.<br/><br/>In the end I got a refund for the exact amount of our order, so I could go and pick my order myself and a measly 300 kr compensation for 2 wasted car trips and approx 8 hours of our time split over multiple days wasted not being able to collect the order as intended.<br/><br/>Terrible service execution and even worse service recovery.

                I placed an order for on 10th May worth over £400. IKEA emailed me on 8th April to tell because they could one item (a plant pot worth £10) was not available, they have refunded my £10 and changed my delivery date to 30th May. What is the sense in that? I checked the item online on the day I received the email about the delayed delivery and the item was actually available for delivery in my postcode. Yet, when I called their customer service, I was told that whoever was responsible for organising my items for delivery could not find the plant pot even if it says that it is available online. This is an absolute disgrace and probably the last time I will be buying any Ikea items!

                I never rate anything in my life but my experience with Ikea has been truly terrible. They have pretty much shut down. Delivery costs are very costly, customer service straight up is unreachable, shipping continues to get delayed. Month in after the order and I still have no clue where my order is.

                Placed an order for a chair and they wanted £9.95 for delivery. They gave me a delivery date 16 days from placing the order. The delivery slot was 12 hours and then they did not even deliver  and did not let me know delivery was not happening. No email address to complain to so queued and spent over 75 minutes on their webchat with just the promise of an evoucher to the value of delivery. LOUSY customer service. If i cancelled and reorderd to use evoucher they said item wass not in stock. They are so evasive and are not up front about any of this.

                IKEA has a 10-year warranty on their couch products, and mine fell apart at the 2-year mark. Even with picture proof, they still insist on picking it up to verify the damage for themselves. In a normal world that fine, but during COVID they should make changes to their procedures to honor their own terms and conditions with the customer. They put the onus on the customer to keep the broken furniture until IKEA feels its okay to pick it up. <br/><br/>They don't really care about following their own rules; their customer service agents just makeup stuff and try to placate you with tiny discounts. Do you want your full refund? I hope your able to play the long game.

                Horrible experience using their ""design your wardrobe"" service.<br/><br/>- Had a useful 1st session where we designed the wardrobe. We agreed that we just needed to go home and decide on whether or not to add a drawer, and then we could pay from home that same day. <br/>- Went home and tried to pay - turns out you NEED the IKEA employee to do this. Everything is ready to go, we just aren't allowed to buy.<br/>-  Call them up next day, wait in line for over 50 minutes (all the while being told it's almost your turn and they value your time...). <br/>- Told that we have book another design your wardrobe meeting, you generally have to book well in advance to get one of these. <br/>- In next meeting, we're told that you have to book with your local advisor, otherwise they cannot send you your wares. We have to book yet another meeting. <br/>- We are now told they can't deliver for 12 days and some of the wares won't be available until 5 days from now. Unfortunately these won't be part of the order. Lots of confusion as to how many people we should be to receive the wares, since they apparently wont deliver into your apartment and which warehouses will have then missing pieces stocked at what time.<br/><br/>I strongly encourage everyone to pay a little extra, so you avoid spending weeks getting your actual wares, several trips to the physical store, and not the least - get nicer looking furniture.

                DO NOT ORDER FROM IKEA DURING THIS PANDEMIC! The order took one month to deliver, but only half arrived. No way to let them know of this within 48 hours, as they require, or any other time: phone customer service down day after day - it just hangs up on you saying they have a large volume of calls.  I totally agree with another reviewer: This is not  bad customer service - it's simply THEFT!

                Chatbot: How can I help you?<br/>Me: Selects option 'Damaged items'<br/>Chatbot: ok, no worries, come back to me when you're less busy.<br/><br/>What?! It's a pre-defined entry and it comes up with that response? Service number says the call centre is open 7 days a week, online says call centre is open 7 days a week. When you try and get in touch everything tells you it's closed (Saturday and Sunday within business hours).<br/><br/>I had ordered multiple new items for the kitchen, including glasses and crockery. It came in a massive box which was breaking apart, not marked fragile, which the delivery driver unknowingly dropped onto my porch. It was a miracle that there were only three broken mugs in it. <br/><br/>And now you are doing everything to avoid dealing with damages. I'm convinced I will have the same issue on Monday. I can't wait to deal with that bloody chatbot again... Pfft.

                WORST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE EVER<br/>This was my first time ordering from IKEA and I couldn't believe this is a service that I'm getting from such famous brand! Lots of important items like bed and mattress were not delivered, We had to just run to an open store on the other side of the city to get an air mattress to don't sleep on the floor!

                Don't place an online order with IKEA. They messed up my order, and there is no way to contact support by phone or email - you have to wait 20+ minutes for an 'online chat'. I had to do this several times just to cancel my order. Go into store or, better still, order from a online retailer prepared to invest in after-sales customer service.

                Horrible website and user experience when ordering. The website narrow down all possible delivery options, giving you only the ones you can do with your current product, with no information about why other options are not available. I spent 1 week calling ant trying to figure out why i can't have my order delivered in express becaus i have to move soon and i want to get an idea about delivery times etc before ordering in due time. Now, once i figured out how their crappy system work, i can't order the items for the day i'm going to move to the new apartement, and i have to find where to stay for 2 days before i can furnish my place with the bare minimum.

                This is all pre-covid lockdown, starting in 2018. <br/><br/>Long story short, I bought a mattress in 2015 with 25 year warranty, and when the bed started falling apart during regular use, they will not respond to my request for warranty claim. I have tried since 2018 and in 2020 had to just get a new mattress from someone else. I have proof that some of my attempts to contact them through the channel they recommended (using the online contact form) did reach them, as I have the ""No reply"" confirmation email telling me that they will get back to me. They never ever did get back to me. Their tactic with warranty claims seems to be to ignore until the customer goes away. I find it disgusting that they would bait customers with long warranties (25 years is the longest I've heard of for mattresses) and then just completely ignore their warranty duties. Anyone else having this issue with IKEA? If there are enough of us suffering this, perhaps we can get a class action suit against IKEA.

                Our bad experience with Ikea started pre coronavirus when they sent us the wrong item we had ordered online. We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures. <br/><br/>When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store. <br/><br/>So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item. <br/><br/>This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.<br/><br/>After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get. <br/><br/>Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money. <br/><br/>I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one.

                I spent 40 minutes on hold to the IKEA webchat for an analyst to not respond my to query, she explained to me that my order was ready to be collected for An Post, I asked for a tracking number and she never replied. After waiting 30 minutes I ended the chat and waited back in the queue for 20 minutes to talk to another analyst. This analyst cancelled my order without my permission and I received an email with a credit invoice that I will now not get for 10+ working days. I am livid. I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless.

                IKEA is the worst customer service company ever. After more than a month I am still expecting my refund, my own money, based on their mistake. The delivery process is unbelievable. They send you an email with the estimate day and when I called to confirm, the same day, they told me that I will receive another email in 7-10 days. Now I’m without sink in my bathroom for more than a week. And for apologize they offered me $20 gift card after I spent $700. The worst, I will never recommend this brand to anyone

                LONG STORY SHORT: <br/>IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam. <br/><br/>DETAILS:<br/>This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks. <br/>So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available. <br/>I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either. <br/>In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one. <br/>Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour. <br/>I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful. <br/>Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy?<br/>At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.

                I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job. <br/><br/>I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.<br/><br/>On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.<br/><br/>I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies.

                If I could give zero stars I would.<br/>I placed an order for a loft bed and mattress almost a month ago. On the first of delivery attempt the drivers gave me one box out of the three items that I ordered. Two boxes that belong to an us another customer and was told that I was supposed to get three boxes here is three boxes if they’re not correct we can’t take them back you have to call customer service. That was three weeks ago I have had another customers order sitting in my house for three weeks my daughter who is five years old has been without a bed for three weeks waiting on this to be delivered. I am now being told that to the mattress that I had ordered and paid for is now out of stock which it wasn’t when I ordered it. The delivery company keeps trying to deliver the frame itself or to pick up the other customers order no attempts to get my order correct have been made. IKEAs customer service has been incredibly awful to say the least. They seem to be more prone to just throw money at the situation instead of trying to fix it. I don’t need money thrown out the situation I need my order I’m at the point where I’m going to just cancel my order in order with somebody else. If you have the option to order with anybody other than IKEA do it worst experience ever will not be shopping with them again

                Cannot give less than one star but would if I could. Ikea took my money but my items have not been delivered despite assurances they would be. Now the webchat told me the system is down and they cannot even check to see what is happening.<br/>I notice multiple other customers in Ireland are having the same problem. This is indefensible. The least they can do is to communicate by email. <br/>I see ikea is giving away free furniture to needy families. Doing one publicity stunt is not going to make up for neglecting paying customers.

Support hung up in the middle of conversation and support manager not responding to follow up email. They said there is nothing they can do and to wait another 2 weeks for delivery. Offered no alternative or compensation. Probably the worst shopping experience I have ever had. <br/>Another week goes by, support not responding on follow up email. No communication.

They send you an email with the estimate day and when I called to confirm, the same day, they told me that I will receive another email in 7-10 days. Now I’m without sink in my bathroom for more than a week. And for apologize they offered me $20 gift card after I spent $700. The worst, I will never recommend this brand to anyone

                Love this store! I always buy various interesting things for home, such as furniture, carpets and other things. This is one of the best furniture and home furnishings stores. In addition, I love the Scandinavian style!

                LONG STORY SHORT: <br/>IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam. <br/><br/>DETAILS:<br/>This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks. <br/>So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available. <br/>I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either. <br/>In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one. <br/>Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour. <br/>I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful. <br/>Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy?<br/>At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.

                I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job. <br/><br/>I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.<br/><br/>On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.<br/><br/>I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies.

                If I could give zero stars I would.<br/>I placed an order for a loft bed and mattress almost a month ago. On the first of delivery attempt the drivers gave me one box out of the three items that I ordered. Two boxes that belong to an us another customer and was told that I was supposed to get three boxes here is three boxes if they’re not correct we can’t take them back you have to call customer service. That was three weeks ago I have had another customers order sitting in my house for three weeks my daughter who is five years old has been without a bed for three weeks waiting on this to be delivered. I am now being told that to the mattress that I had ordered and paid for is now out of stock which it wasn’t when I ordered it. The delivery company keeps trying to deliver the frame itself or to pick up the other customers order no attempts to get my order correct have been made. IKEAs customer service has been incredibly awful to say the least. They seem to be more prone to just throw money at the situation instead of trying to fix it. I don’t need money thrown out the situation I need my order I’m at the point where I’m going to just cancel my order in order with somebody else. If you have the option to order with anybody other than IKEA do it worst experience ever will not be shopping with them again

                Cannot give less than one star but would if I could. Ikea took my money but my items have not been delivered despite assurances they would be. Now the webchat told me the system is down and they cannot even check to see what is happening.<br/>I notice multiple other customers in Ireland are having the same problem. This is indefensible. The least they can do is to communicate by email. <br/>I see ikea is giving away free furniture to needy families. Doing one publicity stunt is not going to make up for neglecting paying customers.

                IKEA Ireland<br/>After asking why my order is 1 week late, they told me it cannot be reeboked so it needs to be cancelled. Refund will take 14 days.<br/><br/>So no product delivered and they keep the money for 5 weeks in total. <br/><br/>Luckily I only bought cheap stuff to keep me going during renovation. Wouldn't buy Ikea products to keep long term as majority looks as if it's made of paper.

Support hung up in the middle of conversation and support manager not responding to follow up email. They said there is nothing they can do and to wait another 2 weeks for delivery. Offered no alternative or compensation. Probably the worst shopping experience I have ever had. <br/>Another week goes by, support not responding on follow up email. No communication. Then out of nowhere, I get a text that my order is cancelled. Lovely. Great job Ikea, you must be proud of yourself

                (Reviewing Ikea UK) Chaotic online experience. Order placed several weeks ago with a long delivery lead time. A week before delivery was due I received a cancellation email without any further information. Customer services advised the product was out of stock and couldn't be delivered. A couple of days later it arrived. Fortunately I hadn't got round to ordering from elsewhere.

On the day of delivery, my husband and I moved the furniture around to make room for three chests that we ordered. No calls and no emails and no delivery. Not next day or the day after.<br/><br/>There was email option only for IKEA business customer so I called IKEA customer service, only to be told ""there are usual number of calls and we cannot take your call"" and a hang up x four consecutive days.<br/><br/>I finally managed to find a page to request refund. I gave them reason for seeking refund and submitted this form. No confirmation of receipt of this request.<br/><br/>What kind of business are they running? Do they not care about their customers? Their reputation? Are they so well off they don't need business from little guys?  If there's no one working, how about telling us that they plan to halt operation so we don't waste an entire week waiting for that doorbell?  It really doesn't take that much effort.

                So disappointed with their COVID-19 delivery service response. I placed an online order 17 days ago. The day I placed my order I received a message saying my order was being handpicked. Then nothing..... When I contacted Ikea today 17 days later, all I get is 'sorry, fed-ex is behind'. I can understand that, but what I do not comprehend is how I can be told Ikea has no idea when it will be delivered. April, May, June? My order is still with the store. Ikea's shipping fees are some of the highest in the industry, yet there is no accountability for giving me any information as to an estimated delivery date on their part. Ikea you need to negotiate a better delivery contract. You need to lower your delivery fees, especially in an age when Amazon does much faster and for free. You need to up your game if you wish to stay in the long run. And, you need to better equip your employees with information so that they can communicate effectively with the customer.

                I ordered two kitchens and received a delivery date. On the evening before the delivery date I received a message that delivery would be postponed to a date they would let me know. Some days later I received a new date: 2 months later! I online changed this date to close to the original one and it was confirmed. One day before delivery was due the same. Eventually I chatted to them and found out that they only deliver items under 25kg. I then tried to cancel the items above 25kg. This wouldn't be possible. I had to cancel the entire order worth well over £4,000. I was then told that I should simply call the refund department to speed up the refund. Customer Services are closed! Excuse me? It looks like I can only arrange the refund if I speak to them. I think I will take this to Trading Standards. This shop needs to be closed for good.

                It is not okay, that you, in this difficult situation, sees a potential and only the good business case in making a lot of extra money by charging a pick up fee of €9,99. We as customers can't choose the alternative that you probably prefer - going to your stores and making a lot of impulse purchases.<br/>The only alternative is to get it delivered, but the delivery of even PostNl packages is estimated to take 2 weeks.<br/><br/>What makes it even worse, is that your colleagues in Denmark (where i'm from) have removed this fee. It is hence free of charge to pick up orders in your Danish stores. Does the right hand not know what the left is doing, or is this just a classic Dutch way of making the most of every given situation to make a few more pennies?

                I have never had a bad enough experience that I've had to share with my entire circle of family and friends just how bad a company can be and to avoid them. <br/><br/><br/>I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.<br/><br/>First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.<br/><br/>I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes.  I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.<br/><br/>The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story. <br/><br/>I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.<br/><br/><br/>I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.<br/><br/><br/>How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.<br/><br/>I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad. They offered me free shipping HAHAHA. Goodbye IKEA. Hello Wayfair....

The person on the phone said my order is cancelled refund will take 5-6 days; and I need to ring their Finance Department with my order number as reference. Which I did today, and after 40 minutes wait, spoke on the phone with the most unhelpful rude person ever who managed to tell me that no my order is not cancelled because I do not have a case number and that I need to speak to Customer Services again. I have tried to ring all day today without being able to get through to anyone. Now I am oncerned that I wll not get my money back. Unprofessional, rude, unhelpful, I have never been treated so badly in my life. Avoid avoid there's other companies out there who remain professional even in these difficult times

                How ABSURD is it that during a time of a national crisis that IKEA is charging $99 for shipping an item I wanted to purchase. As if people were not struggling enough through this time of hard ship. They simply want to take advantage of people and continue to pocket cash. Worst customer service out there and honestly I’m glad that their stores are closed.

                I ordered two kitchens and received a delivery date. On the evening before the delivery date I received a message that delivery would be postponed to a date they would let me know. Some days later I received a new date: 2 months later! I online changed this date to close to the original one and it was confirmed. One day before delivery was due the same. Eventually I chatted to them and found out that they only deliver items under 25kg. I then tried to cancel the items above 25kg. This wouldn't be possible. I had to cancel the entire order worth well over £4,000. I was then told that I should simply call the refund department to speed up the refund. Customer Services are closed! Excuse me? It looks like I can only arrange the refund if I speak to them. I think I will take this to Trading Standards. This shop needs to be closed for good.

                It is not okay, that you, in this difficult situation, sees a potential and only the good business case in making a lot of extra money by charging a pick up fee of €9,99. We as customers can't choose the alternative that you probably prefer - going to your stores and making a lot of impulse purchases.<br/>The only alternative is to get it delivered, but the delivery of even PostNl packages is estimated to take 2 weeks.<br/><br/>What makes it even worse, is that your colleagues in Denmark (where i'm from) have removed this fee. It is hence free of charge to pick up orders in your Danish stores. Does the right hand not know what the left is doing, or is this just a classic Dutch way of making the most of every given situation to make a few more pennies?

                I ordered 15 storage boxes and lids which were delivered on the correct day within the allocated time slot. However 3 of the boxes were broken due to extremely poor packaging.<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances I would return all the items and ask for a refund, however as I needed the boxes urgently for a house move, I couldn't return them.<br/><br/>I used the 12 goods ones, but this is clearly unacceptable.

                I have never had a bad enough experience that I've had to share with my entire circle of family and friends just how bad a company can be and to avoid them. <br/><br/><br/>I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.<br/><br/>First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.<br/><br/>I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes.  I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.<br/><br/>The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story. <br/><br/>I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.<br/><br/><br/>I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.<br/><br/><br/>How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.<br/><br/>I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad. They offered me free shipping HAHAHA. Goodbye IKEA. Hello Wayfair....

                Their deliveries are always late and their customer service number has you pushing numbers then they say too many calls ahead of you and cannot take your call then hangs up. they charged me $221 twice and it never got delivered. I've been on hold now for 18 minutes. that's only after I pushed the number to ORDER, instead of inquiring. bullsh*t. I will never order from them again. she was supposed to just check on the status of my order that's 10 days late and she never comes back on the line.

                With the news about the furniture lawsuit in the papers about faulty dressers, it may be helpful to revive Ikea's value. Mistakes happen, and its how a company reacts to make the change. <br/>--<br/>Ikea is focusing on the value its products bring to their consumers, not with just an affordable pricing structure. They've precisely pinpointed their cost structure in the sweet-spots of wallets. And to supplement that pricing, they give consumers a community to belong to with their open floorplans and a unique buying experience. It almost gives me a vision as to what a success story looks like, with seeing open housing concepts and being able to capture my own independence when I buy a home or condo, and begin to liven it up; just by walking around. Ikea supplies just that right amount of ""gunpowder"" to make an idea explode into action. Cheap, but not discount store quality. What other furnishing company can pull that off?

                Ikea Taufkirchen (München Deutschland)<br/><br/>If it is possible to give even lower score, I'd gladly give it. Today I was waiting for 3,5 hours (I came at 9:50AM and went out from IKEA at 3PM)  just to change 2 small things on already pre-designed kitchen. They keep you waiting for more then 3 hours due to their complete incompetence as how they say: they have no personnel who speaks English.., so instead of informing people like me about that, they keep letting other people to design their own kitchen while (English speakers, wait in the IKEA like morons). More disturbing part was, that I was speaking with them in English and they have replied without any problem. While people were waiting to be served, personnel were having fun, fooling around,  laughing, joking and acting totally unprofessional and inadequate. On top of that, when you request to speak with whoever is in charge at that department, some of their personnel are completely dishonest saying that they mentioned that this takes more then two hours, while to me they claimed it is ""up to 2 hours"" (huge difference)... To IKEA folk: Do you really think that wasting 3.5 hours of customers time is a normal thing..., shifting our plans and agendas, while in parallel you don't even consider that it is important to inform people prior,t  you have issues with your own personnel/man power, and/or that you cannot serve English speaking folk? If you do, then my question to you is, what is wrong with you people?

                IKEA Manchester overcharged us by £21.00. I only discovered this once we got home. I called customer service and was told we'd have to return to the store within 14 days to get a refund and that they'd have to check the CCTV. This was not welcome news as it meant a 1-hour round trip on a work evening which was highly inconvenient. I couldn't believe that they didn't have a better and more sophisticated system in place than looking on CCTV. Despite the frustration, we turned up to the store yesterday evening only to be told that they didn't gave any staff available to check the CCTV so couldn't issue a refund! I was furious and demanded to see the manager. The manager was devoid of any charm or pleasantness and told me it was their policy to check cctv first and that I wouldn't get a refund until the next day. We were given a case number and told we woukd receive a call once the refund was done. I made my frustration known and said I intended to complain. The manager looked totally unconcerned, and reading comments here I can see why. They basically couldn't care less because no one's going to do anything or take any action. I checked their website for their complaints procedure and there isn't even a complaints category included as far as I could see. Again, another clear signal of just how little they care about their customers. After searching via Google I found an email address for Javier Quinones at IKEA and emailed about my situation. Not even an automated response came back telling me how long before I'd receive a reply. By 2.40 pm today, no one had called back so I contacted customer service again. After almost 40 minutes on the phone of stalling and being put on hold for ages several times, I put my foot down and finally got to speak to the manager. I was told he'd contact the store to get them to resolve it but there were all sorts of excuses given for their useless response. I told him I expected the refund to be sorted within the next hour as it was their error and I'd spent so long trying to get this resolved. I tweeted about their useless service on IKEA Support and got a quick public response asking me to DM them. I did this but they did nothing in response except give me another pointless reason for why they couldn't sort it out. So, merely a face-saving exercise in public, which is sheer hypocrisy. We are still awaiting the refund so the only route for us now is via our credit card company. I see that IKEA don't bother to respond to any of the many complaints on here which again just shows their contempt for their customers. With all their millions of profit, they still refuse to give us our £21 back that they took in error. It beggars belief. Truly, I never want to deal with this vile organisation again. It's a toxic company staffed by management who couldn't care less. Avoid at all costs if you want to keep your sanity and money.

                I cant describe how didsapointed i am with ikea Nederlands quality, support, communication. I have bought this couche 16.2.2020, order: 2080870021 had to wait for delivery 7 days... delivery spuposed to come between 16:00-18:00, their came at 15:00.. i have opened 1st box and i see the small damage on the eco leather... scratch that reviele the white fabric underneath... i have opened the rest of the boxes controlled the materisls... last thing was to test the frame / mechanism of the slaapbank, i have unfolded it and directly noticed that 2 out od 8 legs are not touching the floor (3-4cm) space, their hanging in the air... nothing i can do about it, i tried to fold it again, push down.. (the other end legs went up wobbeling up/down) i have contact immediatly ikea via facebook... noone giva a s.h!..t about it, i called ikea phone , noone can not help, contact ikea many other times via facebook msg... every time diferent people was replaying and instead of help , their was bouncing the „ ball” to the other „ colleagues” ... i was tired of that sh!t, finally after sending many pictures of the problem, talking to at least 8 diferent people.. one operator , ^ Lisa, said their  will send me 2 „experts” to my home, with a new bed and new piece that had broken eco- leathet. Ok i was waiting 2 days with no contact, when it happens,all my living room was a Mess because i couldnt put it together this as as i dont use defected products! Aventually after 2 days 2 „ experts” came to me... their cross my door step and look at the unfolded bed and said..” is it from ikea”??? , w.t.f ... no, from media markt... yes i said its ikea, vimle, kind of popular model... the „experts” first time have seen a bed from ikea... i had to show them how to open it, how to close it, their was looking on manual 20 minutes, their was touching the joints like it was a rocket science.. finally their said „ we dont know why its like this” one said , that i can put 2 books under this hanging in the air legs...! WT£I said no! Lisa said, you are comming here, and u bring a new bed and new back rest , where is it? ...yyy, „we dont know nothing about it..” we dont have it.. i immediatly called ikea, i was on the phone 20 minutes and the girl couldnt do anything, she said basicly, its ikea Breda, you have to contact them, i can only arrange exchange for next week!i said NO, i ve been told by Lisa, their will brong me pieces TODAY, as im waiting to use this couche since ive paid for it 1.200e already 9 days to be able to sleep on it or use it, i want this today! Noone couldnt do anything, i was left with this rommel alone... writing to ikea on messenger, was like .. one operator asking again for my order number, then another operator also ask me to fill some form, then another one is totally not aware of nothing. I wasted tons of my time, energy, nerves for nothing. Then their said the „ experts said their couldnt judge the problrm cause the couche was not fully assembly by me! It does not matter! The bed mechanism works the same when is assembled or not, the danage on ecoleather wont heal itself when  I MEAN W.TF PEOPLE, is it some joke? Ikea sell you SH! T and  wash hands, noone can help u, noone can do anything. U just left with a bunch of „collegues” who just reflecting the problem one to the other making a jerk out of you. And noone is responsible. Their lie to u, their misslead You like Lisa did to me. And thats it. You waist your 2 weeks of your precious time for this . I paid 1.200e for the couche, im ashamed i didnt go to any other shop, could buy much better couche, much better design,much higher quality, and for product for 1.200e some help if needed or some respect. Also the back rest pillows of the couch has a huge diference in hardness... one pillow is around 1.5x thicker/harder / more dens, than 2 others which makes it not comfortable thete where is a “hard” pillow. Judge yourself if u wanna go tru all this problems.

                Bought $400 of stuff online. I’m sure it would have been great stuff, but we never received it. My husband and I were both home anxiously waiting the day it was supposed to be delivered. Nobody ever knocked. The whole day passes by. Still no ikea. I get an email from IKEA saying they want us to pay $50 more to deliver it. Why are they charging me twice for a service they never provided? I called ikea support, and they said that apparently nobody will come to deliver the items unless you answer a call from an unknown number a couple hours beforehand. I never answer calls from unknown numbers. It should be illegal to charge people for services you did not provide. I will not be paying for redelivery, and ikea is refusing to refund the $50 I already paid for delivery. Unfortunately, I paid with a debit card, so there is no way to dispute the transaction. We will never purchase from ikea again.

                I have two rooms full of Ikea products and so far I am pleased with them. Indeed they are pricey sometimes, but you can wait for the sales or at least choose only small furniture like desks, tables, beds etc. if you don’t want to pay too much. You have to be careful with the furniture as it can easily get scratched and of course because it’s made of wood splinters you can’t expect it to last for 10 years. But who knows if you take really good care of it, maybe you’ll be surprised. So far I am happy with my products and I didn’t have any bad experiences with them. I usually go there and buy them myself, but when I bought the bed, mattress and wardrobe I had to choose for them to be delivered. The guys were really nice and the furniture was in perfect condition. (I also have mirrors on the wardrobe and they came intact)

                the standard breakfast they offered till recently has changed to an obligatory unhealthy one.<br/><br/>Instead of the previously offered standard breakfast that included, omelet, mushrooms, potato-croquettes, baked tomato and bread,  they removed the tomato, the mushrooms and the potato-croquettes and they added mandatory (or you pay but don't get them) the bacon and Frankfurt sausages. <br/><br/>Nothing juicy any longer (the only juicy element was the removed tomato).

                We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery.  On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was ""dented"" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.)<br/>The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours. The agent told us they were low on stock and would have to call us back on Wednesday (which is a week later). <br/>That call never came either, and on Thursday we called IKEA again, got put on hold for hours, only to be told by the agent that our case needs to be transferred to the after-sales department, which is unavailable currently due to ""high call volumes"". <br/>We called once again on Friday, got put on hold again, got told by an agent again that he'd need to transfer us to the after-sales department, to which by the way there's no direct line, so you have to remain connected through two transfers and two queues or else your enquiries won't even reach a human being.<br/>So after waiting another several hours and 29 other callers ahead of us, we got hold of an agent who, to add insult to injury, tried to offer us 20% discount to keep the broken wardrobe. When we told him no, he said he'd put through a replacement delivery scheduled next Sunday for 1-5pm.<br/>Sunday 5pm passed as well, and on our final call to IKEA we were told the replacement order was never even processed by the system. The after-sales agent implied it took two days to process an order in their esoteric system, and they didn't even offer a way to notify us in the event of an order-processing failure, or somehow guarantee a delivery after everything.<br/>We're left to wait another few days with now little confidence the delivery will ever actually arrive.<br/>At this point I'm at a loss for words.

                I am trying to make a return and it is virtually impossible. Filled out the form on their website 8 times and they emailed me back asking if I want to pay for pickup. I emailed back (per instructions on the email) that YES I wanted a pick up, and I told them the address, and no response. I did this process so many times. Then I called customer service (which I could not reach anyone for two weeks because the lines were busy apparently every single time I called) and they said they would send me a return label, and guess what, they never did :). <br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, there is no other way to take care of this return via internet.

                I spent £4920 on a new IKEA kitchen. I had my builder take out my old kitchen and then booked him to install the IKEA kitchen based on their promised delivery date.<br/>But IKEA repeatedly rescheduled my kitchen delivery, each time only telling me so on the day itself. This delay cost the builder three days of lost work, for which he invoiced me £600.<br/>I told IKEA this and they invited me to send them his invoice indicating that they do offer reimbursements. But while they accepted the legitimacy of the builder's company, his tax status, and of the claim, they refused to pay the invoice on the grounds that his company is not VAT registered - a factor which is of course irrelevant to the claim. It is of course perfectly legitimate for a company not to be VAT registered, but IKEA tell me it is against their own regulations.<br/>So I am left with a bill for £600 from my builder for lost time through no fault of my own, which IKEA refuses to refund on a technicality of their own invention (nothing to do with UK consumer law) which I cannot get around.

                So IKEA has this 365 days return right? complete scam... this is just to attract customers to their shop and screw them up later. I purchased a the Vemile sofa from Ikea, 4 seater. After about 150 days, when i was returning it since it was very uncomfortable and for its extremely low/bad quality,  i called the customer service and asked if i can return back the sofa, stating that I used it for 150 days, I don't have the original package since the return was not planned, and that if i can get refund to the original method of payment, my CC they said yes. so i rented a truck and disassembled the sofa, and took it there to be faced with these scammers. IKEA customer service kept me holding and arguing with them for 4 hours 6:00pm till 10:00pm and be faced with these scammers on the counter that didn't want to return the sofa. why? because they said its used and i don't have the original packaging stating that they only take it if it is with the packaging to ""PUT BACK ON SHELF &amp; SELL IT TO OTHER PEOLE"". Customer service on the phone says something which is not inline with the store customer service. IKEA staff has misunderstanding between them, this shouldn't be reflected on the customers.<br/><br/>3 issues here:<br/><br/>1. customer service on the phone says one thing, Customer service in store says another and argue with you and their manager just disappears for not wanting to Meet the customer, which she was employed to deal with.<br/><br/>2. IKEA wants to put the furniture back on the shelf?? really?? then did i buy a used sofa before and paid the full price of it? are they selling used furniture with the price of a new one?<br/><br/>3. 365 days return policy!! hahahahahahahha tell this to someone that has no common sense. there will always be something that you will pull off not to return.<br/><br/>If anyone has a sense of mind, don't go to IKEA to buy anything. they will only make you lose your money and its value.

                Worst customer service experience from IKEA in Edinburgh. I bought a PAX wardrobe built to the instructions but it all fell apart. The back board wasn’t much stronger than cardboard and the rest was very poor quality. <br/>When i phoned I got a very rude customer service manager who basically told us we had built it wrong. Not sure how she could know that with no evidence at all. I then spoke to someone else over email who looked at pictures and said we had built it wrong. He said this is a very common problem with this wardrobe and therefore he knew we had built it wrong. Problem: if this is a regular problem perhaps maybe there is an issue with this wardrobe?? however they refuse to give us a refund! I will never buy another thing from IKEA. I am absolutely disgusted! My problem with this is that IKEA are a massive corporation and I am me! Customers should not feel like this. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.

                I ordered furniture for +8000 SEK for my house in Sweden from Ikea.se. The order was scheduled for delivery today. Nobody called me about the delivery and hours later I got an email saying the delivery could not be done and to call customer service.<br/><br/>From customer service I learned that - according to IKEA - the delivery driver had tried to call me once and I had not picked up. And they cancelled the delivery. If want a new delivery, I had to pay for deliver again. <br/><br/>First of all, I did not receive this call, despite the fact that Ikea confirmed that my number was correct. I was literally waiting for the phone to call and I can see in my call history that NO ONE tried to call me.<br/><br/>And now the very rude customer service representative requires me to pay again. I told her that wasn't fair since I didn't get the phone call and everything was ready for delivery. She finally told me that I wouldn't get delivery without paying for it again. And hung up on me without rescheduling another delivery, thus effectively hijacking my paid for furniture until I pay up. <br/><br/>Now I have the option to either 1) NOT get the furniture I've already paid for, or 2) pay double fee for delivery, without any guarantee that I'll actually get my furniture - because, as I learned from the customer representative, if the driver can't reach me again, they'll also cancel the second delivery. And so on. <br/><br/>I'm very surprised anyone choses to run a business this way in this day and age. The customer representative thought she was very generous and said Ikea could perhaps pay half the delivery fee, but it's not about the money, it's about what's right and fair. And so far, I've already paid 8000 SEK for nothing.

                Just visited tdy at Edinburgh store found staff helpful and polite. Found a lot of products that interested me however not all products available in this store wS disappointed by this. For the size of this store coukd have done better in that note.<br/>Love the meatballs at the restaurant like the fact you don't get greedy on portion size too. Plenty on offer fir food tables kept in clean condition too plenty of seating lots fir price. Found you competitive a cross the store on prices lots of different products to choose from I bought lighting tdy with copper bulbs. Like things that are different fir my home without the huge whack of a price tag for being different. Plenty of parking for all including disabled users and guide dogs have plenty of avenues to chose from the place is massive. There are shortcuts aswel in the building if you look out for them. Clean well presented on everything is put to view and feel so you know what you getting before buying. The road going in is a bit annoying they expect you to drive all way around to fall into the stingy lane fir access to car parking this is annoying. <br/>Que at till took a while to shorten so patience here if you count to ten or you would probably just leave after getting fed up of the wait. Found staff at tills polite. It's a good store just few niggles or I would have given an extra star. Plenty to choose from minute you enter to when you leave. <br/>I liked my trip I just hope you don't discontinue things as quickly on ranges. <br/>Felt kitchens were if better quality tdy on viewing than what they used to be and very competitive fir price. Good store good parking lots of access for all and friendly service just wee issues to improve. We'll done though your doing a good job I felt valued tdy before parting with my reddies. I reccomend ikea Edinburgh.

Then I hike down the 'pull area' the literally last slot only to find a sign that read ""no longer available"" what??? NO ONE could be bothered to put that sign on at least ONE of the SEVERAL displays?? the item is still listed as 'avaiable' on the store website. <br/><br/>Buh-Bye IKEA I can shop elsewhere with out this much aggravation..

                Awful experience that has put me off buying anything else from IKEA for life. I ordered a sofa and phoned to check whether the delivery service would bring it into my flat and the room of my choice. I was reassured by the IKEA representative that they would climb the external staircase to my flat, so I paid extra for the delivery service. The delivery men refused to carry it up the stairs to my flat (even with my help). After a fuss, they left all 7 boxes outside at the bottom and disappeared. I was left to carry all the boxes up the stairs on my own (including the heavy big boxes weighing 42kgs). After two hours managed to somehow lift it to the top. Once in, I was putting my sofa together and found 4 sofa legs were missing from the pack. I reported it to customer service, who said they would send it in 7-10 days. So now I have to wait another week and a half until I can fix it and sit on my sofa properly.

                I must admit the delivery came on time and all my order was delivered and there was no issues with what I received, however due to being disabled and recently moving in to an apartment I asked the delivery men to put the boxes in the empty bedroom. One of them did not wipe his feet and it resulted in <br/>damage being done to my carpet, he was apologetic and suggested to me to complain to get the carpet cleaned. However when I did complain to Transport services complaints their answer was that there was no damage to the items they delivered so basically who cares that we muddied your carpet. Therefore I would be weary of the delivery services they employ and also I think that the complaints dept is redundant as I complained and nothing was done. I will never use IKEA delivery again thanks to a lack of customer service and the cost of having carpets cleaned.

                Warning - if you are using the £20 Xmas tree voucher use it for one item only if you are buying more than one item as the discount gets pro rata’d - therefore even if you’ve Spent well over £20 and you have to return an item, you won’t be refunded full amount !  I spent £127 and had to return £30 Kingsize bed slats I purchased for an ikea kingsize bed, because they didn’t fit (hasten to add it’s the second set I’ve purchased as the current set, also bought from ikea, don’t fit and fall off every night).  I only got £25.28 back ! So not only have I still spent £97 - I’ve only received £16.72 discount from the promised £20 and still don’t have a bed fit for purpose ~ spoke to customer service and they didn’t really care or offer compensation ~ just suggested I waste a bit more petrol by returning to the store and buying another set 20 cm wider that probably won’t fit and will then also need to be returned and a bit more petrol wasted. I had wanted to return a very expensive cutlery tray (£27) as it has chipped 1st time cutlery was put in it (the wooden looking ones - don’t buy!) but if I do that, once again I won’t get full refund - I’ll lose another £4.25 !  I also have Pax wardrobes drawers - they have faded in different shades so now look striped - another item you shouldn’t purchase is the large hemnes drawers as there is no support underneath and unit bows in middle.

                Very disappointed with the customer service. A price tag on a display item showed a discount. I assumed this discount applies to this product, but was wrong. It appeared that the discounted was only this one particular item.<br/>When I spoke with a customer service person in store, I learned that I should have ""looked at other same products to confirm the discount"" and ""asked a stuff member to give me this item from display, so I could use the discount"". What an utter nonsense??<br/>Lesson: be careful, when you see a discounted product, make sure the discount indeed applies; otherwise you may find yourself as surprised as I did.

                With my first order, everything went well. Delivery in time, good quality items for a good price. So I ordered something else. Shouldn't have done that... I paid over £100, delivery was promised for last Sunday. No delivery, just a message from the delivery company about a delay, with an update promised within 24 hours. No update. I raised an issue, the delivery company promised an investigation, since the parcel had kind of disappeared, result due within 3-5 working days, communicated to the sender, not me. But I was at least promised an 'initial update' within 24 hours. Then I contacted Ikea. They told me I just had to wait. I wanted to cancel the order, but was told this wasn't possible anymore since the items had been sent. Today, no 'initial update', nothing from Ikea either. They just leave me dangling. A good customer service would mean they either send the items again immediately, with me having to promise to send the first parcel back, in case it appeared again miraculously, and them sorting out the problem with the delivery company which, after all, they have chosen, or cancelling the order with a full refund. Instead, I have to wait a week, with no idea what will happen after that. I freely admit that I am a bit spoilt, being so impatient. But a customer-friendly company today simply delivers when promised or tries their utmost to remedy the situation if this does not happen and not just lets their customers wait. I have come to expect such a good service since most companies with online business offer it. Not Ikea, though. This will probably have been my last order with them, whatever happens with this package.<br/><br/>P.S. I finally got Ikea to send a replacement. But, lo and behold - the next day the lost parcel was obviously found again and finally delivered, after a short additional delay. DPD apologized repeatedly for the delay, Ikea didn't. So even the fact that the package finally arrived does not merit more than one additional star. The customer service could have been a lot better.

                Not a great experience. I ordered a table from Ikea to be delivered on a Saturday as I work Sunday to Friday. I ordered some other things with it and the delivery service brought the smaller things but not the table. I then re-scheduled it for my next day off, the following Saturday, when it did arrive. Then Christmas happened, so the next available Saturday, I was ready to put it together. However, it was completely damaged on every corner. I called customer services who said that they would send somebody to get it, on the next Saturday. I gave up 4 Saturdays for a table that I couldn't put up! No compensation offer, nothing. And still no table!

                Ikea is great to shop for affordable furniture and their furniture is durable.  I own a few pieces and have recommended some to friends.  When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting over Thanksgiving I took them to the Columbus, OH store where they purchased a table top and 4 table legs.  They were moving to a new apartment in January - 6 hours away in Michigan.  When they moved in to their apartment, they attempted to assemble their table but one of the legs had a manufacturing defect and would not thread.  We called the Columbus store and at first were told that we could return the $4.00 leg and get a replacement.  My son explained they were 6 hours away from where they purchased it.  He was told there was a store in Canton MI, but of course that was a mere 4 hours away. It would be highly inconvenient for them to make the 4 hour trip for a $4.00 leg, could they please send a new one?  He said he was willing to pay for a new leg, he just didn't want to pay the shipping.  I could return the defective one if necessary when I returned to Ohio.  The CS representative told him she could not do that, so he asked for a supervisor.  After some discussion, the supervisor appeared to understand the dilemma and appeared to want to help.  He said he would send one out, he said he would send a shipping notice to my sons email when it was shipped, etc.  When I first wrote this review I gave IKEA a one star because after all the talk, my son didn't receive a notification or anything and I really didn't think IKEA was going to send the leg, but I was on my way back to OH and my daughter-in-law called and said the leg had come!   Thanks, IKEA.  You came through!  I can fully recommend even distance travelers!

                How can a company exist with such a bad ordering system. Put items in basket, 25% not available, decide to order what I can.press confirm for the order a different 25% now not available. Only available in 3 stores in the UK. Then system doesn't send me a link to a usable Web page I have to go to customer services who print out the order so I can pay at the checkout then easter 25mins for the order to arrive at collections. The scam is they only really want home delivery but then I'd have to take a day off work and pay £39 for the privilege. I've built 5 ikea kitchens, this will be the last one, to much hassle.

                Shocking Customer Service System<br/><br/>I ordered some items on Dec 28th. They sent my shipment to my billing address which is in a different state, instead of sending it to my shipping address. The first time they did this, I had to spend over 2 hours on the phone, and they apologised for their mistake. They then re delivered the items, to my billing address again! 2nd time around. I had to spend another 2 plus hours and they apologized and had to re submit a new order. <br/>They re -submitted my order and said they could deliver on the 20th of Jan. I cancelled my order. I've also sent an email to their head of operations and marketing team. What an awful brand experience!

I recently been ordering stuff online and to get someone on the phone to clarify, confirm or make changes to and order or delivery window has taken hours of my time. Every single time I called it was at least 30 min wait time only for someone to answer and then another 30 min at least for someone to do something about the issue. Pathetic service, a company this big should really do something about their customer service department, it makes the whole shopping experience dreadful and negative.

Only a few days in fact! <br/>The ordering process was quick and easy. <br/>They kept me up to date with my delivery day and time and the delivery drivers delivered bang on time. <br/>They were very professional and polite. <br/>No issues with the packaging at all, all in tact and very very secure. <br/>All items were well packaged and were as expected. <br/>The only niggle I have is being charged £39 for delivery when I’d spent nearly £500 on goods.

All I wanna do is take it back get my money and forget about this horrible experience. It is a lot of money for a cheap particleboard that breaks when you try to put a screw in it correctly.

                @ikeawinnipeg<br/>I tried to return a LACK coffee table that’s still inside the package unopened with a slight tear in plastic packaging.  I lost my receipt and I am fully aware of the policy of having a receipt.  However, I figured since the item was still unopened, I should at least get a store credit on the item.   But they flat out said NO because there’s a tear in the plastic.  I had to argue with the customer rep and told them that plastic is meant to tear and they don’t normally stay intact especially if it accidentally rubs onto something.  But she still wouldn’t take it because they won’t be able to resell the product even though the item is obviously intact, no damage except for the little plastic tear...UNBELIEVABLE!!!!   The WORST return policy I have ever heard and the WORST customer service ever😡

                We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems.  After we bought the 1st order on a ""click and collect"" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him.  For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned.  The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no.  They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more. Thereafter I was called by an IKEA manager saying that they did not credit any money for injury because there was ""no loss of money in a transaction"". I found this to be rather surprising.  I was close to having to get stitches and after all of the time spent on the phone trying to call (they must have asked me to call back about 10 times with average wait times of 45 minutes), cutting myself and trying to help them by locating required information, I was astonished. I would have expected more.   But alas, IKEA has changed.

                Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back.

In the shop they said it is a different system, they could not order it.<br/>And, when you finally decided to order it online, you go to your basket, the item is ""op voorraad"", and when you hit the Order button: ""Het spijt ons, de gekozen artikelen zijn nit op voorraad.

                Love IKEA furniture and have been a loyal customer for years, but their customer service it ridiculous! I recently been ordering stuff online and to get someone on the phone to clarify, confirm or make changes to and order or delivery window has taken hours of my time. Every single time I called it was at least 30 min wait time only for someone to answer and then another 30 min at least for someone to do something about the issue. Pathetic service, a company this big should really do something about their customer service department, it makes the whole shopping experience dreadful and negative.

                Wow, I actually can not believe the amount of  negative reviews that Ikea have. <br/>Especially judging them on my own experience. <br/>I ordered three items and despite the Christmas period they had been delivered in less than a week. Only a few days in fact! <br/>The ordering process was quick and easy. <br/>They kept me up to date with my delivery day and time and the delivery drivers delivered bang on time. <br/>They were very professional and polite. <br/>No issues with the packaging at all, all in tact and very very secure. <br/>All items were well packaged and were as expected. <br/>The only niggle I have is being charged £39 for delivery when I’d spent nearly £500 on goods.

                This is the worst experience I’ve ever had in my 50 years of buying furnishings and cabinets. It’s impossible to put this cheap stuff together. They give me no clues. All I wanna do is take it back get my money and forget about this horrible experience. It is a lot of money for a cheap particleboard that breaks when you try to put a screw in it correctly. Please don’t throw your money away like I did. I am an attorney and I do not think that this place will last long with this kind of service and bad quality.

                @ikeawinnipeg<br/>I tried to return a LACK coffee table that’s still inside the package unopened with a slight tear in plastic packaging.  I lost my receipt and I am fully aware of the policy of having a receipt.  However, I figured since the item was still unopened, I should at least get a store credit on the item.   But they flat out said NO because there’s a tear in the plastic.  I had to argue with the customer rep and told them that plastic is meant to tear and they don’t normally stay intact especially if it accidentally rubs onto something.  But she still wouldn’t take it because they won’t be able to resell the product even though the item is obviously intact, no damage except for the little plastic tear...UNBELIEVABLE!!!!   The WORST return policy I have ever heard and the WORST customer service ever😡

                We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems.  After we bought the 1st order on a ""click and collect"" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him.  For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned.  The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no.  They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more. Thereafter I was called by an IKEA manager saying that they did not credit any money for injury because there was ""no loss of money in a transaction"". I found this to be rather surprising.  I was close to having to get stitches and after all of the time spent on the phone trying to call (they must have asked me to call back about 10 times with average wait times of 45 minutes), cutting myself and trying to help them by locating required information, I was astonished. I would have expected more.   But alas, IKEA has changed.

                IKEA’s customer service is so bad that I had to call 20 times to talk to a rep to report a problem with the items delivered to me. They have delivered full/double size bed frame side rails for a queen bed. I have paid for their delivery and assembly services. I was told that they will send me the correct items in a week and left me with no options other than to hire a contractor for assembly again. I have paid for assembly once already. I would not recommend IKEA for buying furniture.

                Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back.

                Fake return policy.  Recent change to their return policy as of Nov 1, 2019.  You have to have a receipt or card for them to return the item. They will not accept even if the product is damaged and refused to give you a store credit.  Hang onto those receipts.  Not happy!!   We traveled two hours to return them and then had to donate it to ikea as we had no room in the car.  Definitely not a 365 return policy.

After speaking to customer service earlier in the week (3 times) including a young man who just sniffed his cold continuously down the phone at me, I was given an assurance of the delivery time. 2 hours after, it finally arrived.

                BEWARE - IKEA removes bad review for their products from their website citing ""policy violation"" and refuses to explain which exactly policy does it violation when you talk to their customer service. This practice is as bad as quality of their products. So I'll post my experience with their product here for everyone to read.<br/><br/>I know IKEA makes cheap furniture, I do not expect much believe me. But I was horrified how degraded IKEA quality over the years. I have a bookcase that I have purchased from IKEA about 10 years ago and it's a solid piece of wood, it's heavy constructed, still holding up fine. I wanted to replace it with two of these bookcases thinking that I'll be getting similar build level. I was so wrong. I guess IKEA cut all possible corners in 10 years to make it as cheap as it can be to manufacture. It's so flimsy and unstable, the sides are not solid pieces but just a frame with think inserts. The bookcase is constructed in a such way that it can not be put flush against a wall if you have baseboard because the read ""legs"" do not have a cutout for it. Quality of woodwork is horrible - it's uneven, unrefined and plain bad. Two of my side boards are not even glued properly and sliding back and forth in slots. I'm not going to talk about the design because it's non-existent. Paint is as cheap as everything else and while it's called dark-brown it's in reality simply black probably for the purpose of hiding bad wood quality. I will repeat again, I was extremely disappointed when I have unpacked the bookcase, this whole thing just screams in your face - CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Now I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my time to try to put it together or I can just throw it away immediately. I wouldn't complain if it would cost you $50 but for $150 this is just a robbery in a daylight. I will never recommend to anyone to buy anything in IKEA from now on, IKEA quality went too downhill in the last years.

                I made a partial order for my kitchen. They did not have it in stock at my local IKEA store. I had to make an order online and then pick it up at a delivery point. All good so far.<br/><br/>My nightmare started when I was ready to to finalise my order with the other items. As before, not in stock at the local IKEA store. No worries I make an online order and pick it up at a delivery point.<br/>Order about to be finalised and when the options for delivery comes up I have 3 to choose from. And the closest will have me 580 kilometers going by car. I ask the support what is going on and they say that it is no system error. I told them that I ordered last week and you delivered locally. <br/><br/> - Yes, for these items we did, but not these ones you order now. <br/><br/>I tell them that the items are in the same series and I must have the same style in my kitchen. You must be wrong?<br/><br/> - Nope, it is correct<br/><br/>So, with this I MUST WARN YOU. If you want IKEA...DO NOT BUY ONLINE and think they can deliver.

                I purchase whole beds, wardrobes and kitchen stuffs worth more than €1000 in June 2018. From Ikea Valencia. Everything was in box, now after decoration ended, I opened the boxes and main part of beds are missing, Ikea told me than yes we made mistake, we didn't send you everything, but you should check and told us. That means I had to do their jobs as well. Now I can't use the beds at all. Three of them. Worst company worst service Not recommend at all.Compré camas enteras, armarios y artículos de cocina por valor de más de € 1000 en junio de 2018. Todo estaba en caja, ahora después de que terminó la decoración, abrí las cajas y falta la parte principal de las camas, Ikea me dijo que sí, cometimos un error, nosotros  no le envié todo, pero debe verificarlo y contárnoslo.  Eso significa que también tuve que hacer su trabajo.  Ahora no puedo usar las camas en absoluto.  Tres de ellos.  La peor compañía, el peor servicio No lo recomiendo en absoluto.

                Very poor online experience. Tried to order some stuff. Web page checkout is quite impossible to work with. At the end I got my order in ""ghost"" mode. I can see my card being reserved for certain amount but IKEA web is now showing me my order nor did it give me any order number to track. Same goes for my card provider, they did not list my order number nor do they provide me with a way to contact the IKEA for that particular thing as the amount is only reserved but not confirmed by IKEA.

                Very disappointed! We were moving into a new place and made sure to order early (Nov. 25, 2019) so we have it on time. We bought a sofa bed, bed frame, TV stand, dining set, duvet, pillows, etc. from them. Delivery was supposed to be on Nov 30, 2019. They said everything was on track. We waited for 4 hours and called XPO and IKEA several times with a LOT of waiting time on the phone only to find out that it was not coming and no one updated us regarding this. We had to call and reschedule. <br/><br/>Same thing happened for Dec. 2 delivery and again on Dec. 5. XPO and IKEA staff were giving false updates and have NO IDEA where our orders are. Either they weren't being transparent or have no clue at all. <br/><br/>We ended up having to cancel because when we called them again, they said it was in the WRONG warehouse and was going to be delivered on Dec. 10...  They were very unapologetic about it and did not even offer any solutions. Would NOT recommend this to anyone! We wasted so much of our time calling and waiting. Worst service ever!

                We've approached ikea for remodeling of our kitchen they've suggested to pay 3000 so that the planner would visit our home and take the measurements and give us the design and we wouldn't have to visit the store until the selection of the counter top and other products. As told, planner has visited along with other personal and took the measurements (which also happened after many follow ups). They've sent us the plan which didn't include the whole kitchen but a part of it (which also was done late). Later after contacting the planner she said she would send the whole plan the very next day but it has been weeks that there is no progress nor the design was sent. They have not replied to calls or mails. Such a poor service. Didn't expect such a bad service from them. Being a reputed brand shameful for having done this. This is not the reason we have paid 3k.

                We went into store to buy a mattress for our granddaughter. We chose the hyllestad pocket sprung mattress after trying in store and with advice from the staff.

We put the mattress in place however the  mattress is rock hard with a ridge in it. We telephoned customer services who said that the 365 day return policy did not apply to mattresses as stated online. We were not told this in store. We have been advised that we can only exchange it for an alternative however Ikea  acknowledge that the next mattress up isn’t  available in a single. When we said it was not the same as the in store model that we had trialled customer  services said that the store mattresses weren’t like the ones sold as people had tried them?? and  they advised us to sleep on it until it became comfortable. Our granddaughter is only four and weighs just over 2 stones therefore her altering the mattress would be an impossibility! The mattress has been removed and is standing in our hallway as we have no use for it. We tried to write this review on the Ikea Website however Ikea have censored the review and have prevented us from submitting it. We have wasted a significant amount of time and money and will not purchase from Ikea again. We are shocked by the way Ikea have dealt with this problem and by the fact that they would not publish a truthful review. Shame on you Ikea!.

                IKEA customer service is awful if you need to have them pull furniture.  so, expect to wait over 30 minutes when they aren’t even busy.  Next, you really can’t exchange - you can only return and then go through the incredibly long line again as they help can’t go get one and let you exchange.  So, after waiting over 35 minutes to get a desk - i couldn’t exchange something.  Poor customer service - especially as the pullers and return people were just standing around.  Crazy!

                I use ikea often. I buy bulbs from them because the bulbs have great life guarantees  At least that's what I thought. 2 x E27 600 lm I bought last year went faulty. Both flash off and on and make crackling sounds so I brought them back to the store yesterday. I had no receipt but was certain they would replace the bulbs, but NO. They said they couldn't  see on their system where I had ever bought bulbs on my family card and refused my request. I know my card wasnt recognised by their scanner a couple of times and they replaced my faulty card but this was rejected by the returns department. I'm very disappointed by this matter because the bottom line here is that these bulbs are obviously not as good as the IKEA staff member told me they were when he said they had a lifetime guarantee. He said if they go faulty, just return them and IKEA will replace them. Not true.

                We had the worst experience with the third party delivery company (XPO) IKEA uses in NY City. Their staff were incompetent, rude and aggressive with my husband and our building manager / concierge. XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem. <br/><br/>My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City. The time you would spend resolving problems with the delivery company would cost you a lot more than just buying your furniture elsewhere.

                Ikea has got to be the worst company I have ever dealt with <br/>Bought a dressing table/desk a few days ago started assembling then noticed a side panel was damaged so tried ringing my local Gateshead store would of been quicker walking the 15 mile trip to speak to customer services. Rang the helpline about 6 times to be put in a 20 to 30 minute wait and even after waiting the time they said still no answer so gave up without resolving my problem so another trip to the store at my time &amp; expense. And they have the complaints procedure non existent so you are going round in circles to contact them <br/>AVOID AT ALL COST CHEAP COMPANY WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE

                Every single time I call to try to get help for my order I keep getting the same message - We did not receive your selection. Goodbye.<br/>Then it just automatically drops my calls.<br/><br/>I was finally able to find some contact email to get through to them.<br/><br/>So basically I put in a huge order almost 2 weeks ago and they were missing an entire couch I ordered. I've been trying to get them to send me my couch but so far no luck and one basic email saying how sorry they are. So far worst customer service ever. Not sure what to do. I really expect better for such a huge company.

                Horrific, third party delivery company employed by IKEA. If you cant pick it up at the store and take it with you BEWARE! Let me just tell you that if you do not heed this advice and you trust them to deliver something to you in a manner that you will find pleasing and excellent....YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK! I had to reschedule a delivery for some stand up mirrors (that I ordered online and spent over $500.00 + dollars for.  I was challenged by uncaring, incapable and at worse, ignorant service personnel at every turn. To be fair, the employees of the third party deliver service that IKEA contracts with in the San Diego County area were the ones that I would corral into the ignorant and uncaring category. However, some of the staff at IKEA's 800 number fell into this category as well. It got to a point where they were mad at me for being frustrated. As if I didn't have a right after 3 failed delivery attempts (and broken promises by them) and me taking 2 days off from work to be there to receive my product and no delivery people showing up....and not even having the courtesy to call me and tell me that they weren't coming? The service failures are so egregious it nearly borders on conspiracy theory material. <br/><br/>To this day, I have still never received my shipment nor gotten a refund. I even responded to several of their automated follow up messages and gave them a 1 star.....I still never heard anything from whomever was supposed to be monitoring the customer review process! It defies logic.  I have never wished ill upon any company other than the perhaps say, the IRS. However, I do sadly hope that IKEA goes the way of the dodo bird and becomes extinct. This is because I truly feel they don't care about me/us enough to step up and listen when their clients are asking for their help. <br/><br/>P.S. I noticed when looking for review sites for IKEA, that the independent review sites that IKEA does not control have VERY low scores from customers. However, IKEA's own client feedback site seems to contradict that with much higher aggregate reviews???? Um, who's review site do you trust? Pretty safe to say that the independent review sites like this one with an average customer review score of just over 2 is probably a lot closer to the truth. I hope this review has been helpful. Thank for taking the time to feel my pain. Trust me, I have much better things to do with my time :-( ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for nothing IKEA

                IKEA BESTA.  The items are lovely the delivery and pre paid assembly service a nightmare.  IKEA does not take responsibility once you buy.  You are pretty much on your own.  Their recorded message for the After Sale Team is ""We have a higher than normal call volume please call back later"". If you speak to customer service they Transfer you to the After Sale Team. Where you will receive the same message again and again and again.  A continuous irritating loop resulting in zero progress. No wonder why their call volume is higher than normal.  I wouldn't do this again

                Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.<br/><br/>I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc. <br/>I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never.<br/>In Germany things look different.<br/> <br/>I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.<br/><br/>Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment. <br/><br/>Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:<br/><br/>1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service. <br/>I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours. <br/>The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated ""support"" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.<br/><br/>2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.<br/><br/>3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English. <br/>In Denmark it's not a problem.<br/><br/>I am truly disappointed by Ikea. <br/>My attitude to the company has changed dramatically. <br/>I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.<br/><br/>With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave. <br/>If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.<br/><br/>That's all.

                Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.<br/><br/>For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.<br/><br/>All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before.

                We designed our wardrobe (PAX) in their program. Everything seemed great until we got our delivery. Somehow An additional wardrobe was added to our order which we paid for as well. The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up. I used to be an IKEA fan, bought my kitchen there for +100.000 SEK but no more IKEA for me after this dreadful service.

                Where do I start.  I purchased a desk on the 29 Oct and exactly 1 year and 1 day later the drawer facia fell apart along the grain.  When contacting both the store and customer services it was explained that because it was out of the 1 year warranty there was nothing they could do.  This I can accept, however, there is no way of getting a new facia which means I either buy a new desk just to obtain the facia or as suggested by Cutomer Services, I look on eBay.  Then I ask if there is any further way of complaining I am told no.  I cannot even contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part.  Great Customer at the heart process, I don't think so.

                Click and collect program is garbage. I received an email stating that my order was ready for pick up. That’s all it said, two days later I showed up at the store to pick up my order, and apparently it had been refunded and returned. Because I didn’t pick it up that same day I got the email. The email said nothing like I have 24 hours to pick up the items or they’re being returned. The things I bought were on sale and they are not honoring the sale price of me having to go back and buy them again. They also never communicated that the items are being refunded and returned. I still have not been refunded on my credit card, they said they will process the transaction eventually. They need way better communication and customer service. I wouldn’t recommend using the click and collect service. Unless you’re waiting by your email for the notice to go get your items immediately.

In my replacement for 7 items, only ANOTHER TWO came. And those 2 items were the WRONG size. At this point I was over it and asked for a refund. My refund was supposed to be $21 I got refunded $6. I don't know what's going on over there but what a mess! Literally every thing they did was messed up. I love Ikea but the online site is a nightmare.

                Paid for their kitchen measuring service in order to get an estimate for kitchen installation.  Forget about followup, there is none.  Also have tried to call 4 times to their kitchen service department, all you will ever get is a message that they are too busy to take your call, please call again.  I would never purchase their kitchen cabinets and installation, because you would never get any service from them if you had a problem.

                Worst delivery experience, when first of all they tell you that you are going be delivered between 1 to 5pm and the transporter call you almost at 5pm to say that he is going to delivery your item in 1h. If you want to make sure to have your package from IKEA, choose a off day! You must stay all day long for them...<br/>So I couldn’t be at home during that time, they returned my package without saying nothing. No email from the transporter, no email from IKEA.. I had to call the service of IKEA (had to wait from at least 30-40min to have them on phone..) to be able to reschedule my delivery, and now they tell me that it not possible until next week. <br/>Please make sure that if you buy from IKEA that you can pick up your furniture in person at the store ! You will always have issue with their delivery services...

                We had the worst experience with the third party delivery company (XPO) IKEA uses in NY City. Their staff were incompetent, rude and aggressive with my husband and our building manager / concierge. XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem. <br/><br/>My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City. The time you would spend resolving problems with the delivery company would cost you a lot more than just buying your furniture elsewhere.

                Buyer beware. Some products are so cheaply made or take forever to assemble with unclear instructions. Love going there but always have to keep this in mind.

                Paid for their kitchen measuring service in order to get an estimate for kitchen installation.  Forget about followup, there is none.  Also have tried to call 4 times to their kitchen service department, all you will ever get is a message that they are too busy to take your call, please call again.  I would never purchase their kitchen cabinets and installation, because you would never get any service from them if you had a problem.

                Worst delivery experience, when first of all they tell you that you are going be delivered between 1 to 5pm and the transporter call you almost at 5pm to say that he is going to delivery your item in 1h. If you want to make sure to have your package from IKEA, choose a off day! You must stay all day long for them...<br/>So I couldn’t be at home during that time, they returned my package without saying nothing. No email from the transporter, no email from IKEA.. I had to call the service of IKEA (had to wait from at least 30-40min to have them on phone..) to be able to reschedule my delivery, and now they tell me that it not possible until next week. <br/>Please make sure that if you buy from IKEA that you can pick up your furniture in person at the store ! You will always have issue with their delivery services...

                Two orders in the last two months have arrived minus a part of the order. Forty quid delivery for incorrect delivery and no delivery refund. Never ordering from them again.

                We bought an IKEA kitchen and had a problem with a damaged oven. After going round and round with IKEA WHIRLPOOL and getting nowhere on a replacement I stopped into the Frisco, TX store and spoke with Alan in the kitchen dept and explained what had happened. He directed me to returns where I spoke to Marty who called another guy named Jordon and we had the oven replaced by the following Monday. <br/>I am so thankful for these people at the store in Frisco and my new kitchen looks fabulous with all appliances exceeding my expectations (microwave, double oven and very quiet and nice dishwasher. Shout out to Esther at IKEA Frisco for helping us plan.<br/>Whirlpool on the other hand has the worst customer service I've ever experienced! If you have a problem with one of their appliances from IKEA I highly suggest you go to the IKEA store you bought your appliance from and get help from them.<br/>Kathie<br/>Corinth, TX

                Ikea Misleads customers on assembly - their staff tell you, all included in the assembly service, wait until Flatpack guys arrive. They try to charge you extra for all sorts. It’s shocking and disgraceful customer service. Despite I asked asked Ikea staff 4 times, that lights will be fitted to wardrobe - which they confirmed, 4 times as well however on the day, assembler left without even installing the wardrobe ! I challenge Ikea to prove all above is false/incorrect. <br/>Dr Hameed

                Where is Customer service?<br/>I made an order of 8 Christmas soup bowls plus some plastic tubs.  Two of the bowls were broken into many pieces.  I Called the Contact phone number 4 times today.  I pushed all the buttons until I got to ""your call will be transferred"".  That was a big lie.  2 times they phone hung up at that moment so I tried twice more.  It didn't hang up but the phone went silent as I waited for 15 minutes.  Are they all asleep in Sweden?  This is disgusting.  I tried contacting by email.  No go.  Really disappointed.  Won't be ordering from them again if they have no customer service.  Total dud.

                Horrible delivery process from Select Express!! First time around they never called me so I wasn't home. Then was told by IKEA that I would be charged for a re-delivery which was only waived after 45 minutes on the phone explaining and re-explaining why I should not be charged. Once it was rescheduled and confirmed by automated process, I waited at home during the entire 4 hour window but no delivery truck showed up. Another hour on the phone (mostly on hold) to try to straighten things out.  This time I was told that the delivery company never received the items from IKEA. What a mess!

                A lot of ikea’s items is made wrong so it either doesn’t work or just are on the edge to breaking. I do not recommend ikea to anyone who wants workong furniture. If you want to get a new model then its probably going to take about 5-20 days

                Worst experience I had in a while. They didn't come during the window they were supposed to deliver the items. They told me the best would be to cancel and pick it up at the store, which I did, but they never refunded the shipping cost and wont' do it. Then I bought the items online to pick up. When we went to pick up the items, the person said the items weren't there even though we had a confirmation email. Again, I lost money and time and nothing. They are also super slow to respond by email and sometimes never get back to you. When one calls, it is a crap shoot. Sometimes they answer, mostly the automated voice hang up because of volume of calls. Unfortunately, I will never buy from ikea ever again.

                We had a kitchen fitted in July 2018. Some of the lights failed and there was damage to doors and drawers because they had not been fitted properly. They delivered new parts in June 2019. Arranged a fitter who didn't turn up and since then have done nothing to resolve this including responding to my emails. I even visited the store and got no-where. Really disgusting service.

                Ikea is attacked by the right wing, because some people feel that the word ""WINTER"" is not ""CRISTMAS"". This is ridicoulus and just goes to show how RACIST AND FASCIST people are these days. People would rather give a bad review, than think. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU, AND YOU WILL BE EXECUTED AS THE TRAITORS YOU ARE TO HUMANITY!

                Beware if anything goes wrong with your product. Refrigerators are NOT built to last. My 5 year and 4 month old American Style Fridge freezer catastrophically failed. Fridges are supposed to last at least 10-20 years. Samsung refused to replace it despite it being marginally over the 5 year mark. There were multiple cracks in the carcass behind the coolant where you cannot see until it is too late. Samsung service was appalling. Says so much about the quality of their fridges, their appreciation for their customers, their acknowledgment that cracking in the carcass at 5 years is not right, and their respect for the environment while violating up to 5 of the UN Sustainable Development goals it claims it fulfills on its website. This huge fridge, with all its plastic will now go to landfill while leaving a customer in the lurch in the middle of a pandemic.

                I really believe Samsung should win awards for their lies and excuses as to why it’s not covered under the warranty?<br/>This is my second Samsung galaxy phone and I will never use Samsung again,<br/>In October 2019 I up graded from Galaxy s8 to Galaxy note 10 lovely looking phone good features but being glass it is fragile so for this reason from day 1 I put it in a genuine Samsung wallet £45 not cheap and also paid an extra £30 to have a screen protector fitted in store.<br/>In April 2020 whilst using my phone still in mint condition the volume button became unattached and how I found out that Samsung will not honour their warranty.<br/>I phoned customer services to be told “that’s not covered under warranty it’s physical damage” ? As I explained I had researched the problem on line and found it has happened to a few phones so it must be a manufacturing fault? Customer service response “I’ll send a courier to pick it up and the engineer can decide” confident that in mint condition and not having any physical damage it would be repaired? WRONG I got an email saying they had received my device followed by an email saying it’s not covered under warranty and it would cost me £219 to mend the broken screen?<br/>I immediately phoned customer service to question this Stating I have taken photos the courier driver took photos there wasn’t any mark on the phone when it left my house.<br/>Customer service “ I phoned the engineer the screen is cracked top left hand corner so not covered under warranty”<br/>Arguing my case it was fine when the courier driver took it. I was supposedly escalated to customer solutions?<br/>Who informed me it did have a cracked screen And because of this it wasn’t covered under warranty and they would send me pictures showing this today ( never arrived) and contact the courier for his pictures,<br/>A Few days later I phoned to find out what was happening no one knew? Then I received an email to say it didn’t have a cracked screen? What the engineer meant ( after naming crack top left hand corner) was that his words “ The volume button sits on the screen off the phone? So to replace the volume button the full screen will need to be replaced” So they would class this as physical damage and chargeable and their engineers will not make any necessary repairs until payment is received.<br/>Basically you don’t have a warranty with Samsung I urge anyone with a dispute to contact trading standards reading the reviews something needs to be done and hopefully with enough complaints they will look into Samsung warranties

                I bought a monitor from their online shop. The monitor was not delivered. There has been no refund and their Philippines based customer service centre is hopeless.<br/><br/>Since I can show that my monitor never left the Samsung warehouse and I have nothing to show for my money, I assumed a refund would be straight forward and not involve a claim through PayPal. I was wrong and I have been forced to start a case.<br/><br/>I - along with most reviewers here - regret having dealt with this company. It has been an awful experience.

                The worst experience I’ve ever had with a company. They accept no responsibility for the failure of their products. Continued to blame my cable company even though cable company had come out 4, yes I said 4 times to do all they could and problem was not on any of our other 4 TVs. I was very courteous and sent them all documents they asked for proving it was only 3 months old when problem first occurred. Then I get an email stating that they are closing the case! Unbelievable lack of customer care.  STEER CLEAR OF  SAMSUNG.

                Samsung is the worst company I have ever worked with. Their customer service is terrible. I usually don't bother writing reviews, and I am usually not one to complain, but Samsung is so terrible that I thought I should warn others against using them. I got a Galaxy A10E (a terrible, terrible phone) through them and it has not worked since I got it. It does not receive text messages, a basic function that should work. I have sent my phone in four times, but each time they have just sent me back my original phone with no fixes, even though they have told me multiple times that they would send me a replacement/my money back. Those in customer service are very poorly trained and depending on the person I have talk to, downright rude. DO NOT USE SAMSUNG!!!!

                I have ALWAYS sworn by Samsung products and have a house full of them. So of course I decided to order my son a laptop. Due to the virus his senior year has pretty much been a disaster and he just wants it over with. I originally had the laptop going to Texas since thats where he's at. He had the option of coming to Utah and getting his diploma done sooner so that's what we're doing. Laptop won't actually ship for another 2 weeks and they won't allow me to change the shipping address. So the computer will get to Texas the day he leaves to come to Utah and customer service just tells me ""oh well"". Either cancel and reorder (which will take another month) or pay more money to have it sent from Texas to Utah. Your service is horrible and with the way things are right now you would think they could work around that. I was going to order a few more things from them but probably not now. First time buying directly from Samsung. Last time.

                Hopeless customer service. Our fridge stopped working in mid April, only 1 year old. We have been left for 3 weeks, mid pandemic, with no fridge and £150 of wasted, rotten food. I have had to shop every day, not great currently. Samsung customer service has been awful, even John Lewis are amazed at their behaviour. They have been so unhelpful and just seem to be trying to evade the guarantee. Plus 3 hours on hold on the phone. Don't buy anything from Samsung.

                I purchased a Samsung tumble dryer DV90H8000HW in 2017, having just passed the 3 year mark it has developed a HE fault, a Heating Error!  Having purchased the product with a 5 year warranty I was very dissatisfied to know upon calling Samsung that the warranty had expired late November 2018!! How was this possible? Well, the lady I spoke to said the product came with a two year warranty and in order to qualify for the 5 year warranty I needed to register for it within 90 days of purchase! apparently the supplier had the responsibility of advising me of this! (How does the period of time from 2017 to 2018 total two years?)<br/>Samsung are not prepared to honour the 5 year warranty and can only provide me with an engineer at my own expense, or a 25% discount voucher for me to purchase a replacement item. Having advised the Manager that I spoke to on the phone how dissatisfied I was with the outcome of having been provided with a faulty product I then requested an email address to provide feedback to their customer services team. I was reassured that this  would be sent to me via email along with the discount code if I chose to use this,  four days later I still await this!!  <br/><br/>3 years use out of a top end dryer surely this is not acceptable Samsung!! Previous budget dryer lasted in excess of 15 years but as you were offering a bigger drum size, and better specs I thought I'd give it a try, big mistake! The fact that you are also unwilling to accept that this unsuitable it also quite appalling.

                Samsung have happily taken my money for years. Due to a Smart Switch fault I have lost tonnes of data. Samsung did nothing to attempt to maintain me as a customer after they accepted liability.<br/><br/>Now have the S20 Ultra. Phone fell from less than half a metre drop today and screens cracked. Company is willing to take another £269 for a screen repair on the basis ""no matter how tough, glass breaks, that's why our rubbish bit of tech costs over £1,500"".<br/><br/>While we're at it, space zoom isn't amazing. Cameras alright. Phones not resistant to wear and tear. And the company DOES NOT care about the customer, only your money. Wish I could rate zero stars. Will not be purchasing from them again.<br/><br/>Greedy. Greedy. Greedy.

                Actually so disgusted with this company. Forked out over £800 for a smart TV, but the money grabbing didn't stop there. There are built in ads on the smart menu bar. When the TV starts up, it automatically goes to the god awful TV plus app, really bad if you have kids as it shows ads for movies unsuitable for children. Worst of all, you cannot disable any of it whether you agree to the terms and conditions or not. I also have a galaxy watch and s10. The galaxy watch isn't compatible with the Google store, it isn't compatible with Google assistant, there are empty menus in the galaxy watch store, don't even waste your money. As for the S10+, I went from the S9 to this model, and there was barely any difference between the two. Also they forced their bixby software on you with that awful side button. Bixby is just awful, plain awful, mostly because it does not understand 90% of what you ask it and their are constant updates that improve nothing. A voice assistant that doesn't understand your voice, useful, very useful Samsung... As you can tell I HAD been a loyal customer to Samsung owning a lot of their products, but honestly I will never buy another one of theirs again. They don't care about their customers or how to improve their products for the betterment of their consumers, only their own interests and profits matter to them.

                terrible customer service. I called in to return new device and get Samsung to return my traded in device back. The person from cancellations team called James shockingly kept ignoring me and it sounded like as if he kept sleeping and waking up. I ended up telling him  not to cancel the order and I decided to keep my new phone due to the stress I had to go through to get through to them and then this James guy topped it off. if anyone tried to return their new phone and get traded in device back they will understand what I mean. absolutely shocking customer service

                As a former Samsung employee. The customer service is awful and not enough is invested in this. But I have met the Samsung team in Soul and this would disgust them. As they are about customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, I believe the UK faction is letting them down. However having worked mostly with John Lewis stores, I recommend them for their customer service if anything goes wrong so I would recommend buying any electronic products from John Lewis. John lewis match most prices in the market as well but with exceptional services. Forgot to mention that the products are excellent but you expect support when sh** goes wrong.

                As a former Samsung employee. The customer service is awful and not enough is invested in this. But I have met the Samsung team in Soul and this would disgust them. As they are about customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, I believe the UK faction is letting them down. However having worked mostly with John Lewis stores, I recommend them for their customer service if anything goes wrong so I would recommend buying any electronic products from John Lewis. John lewis match most prices in the market as well but with exceptional services. Forgot to mention that the products are excellent but you expect support when sh** goes wrong.

                Shockingly bad customer service when something goes wrong.  Charged me for tablet repair that I feel should have been covered by warranty - itself irritating but made infuriating by the complete lack of engagement, and lack of any way to escalate the issue to a higher level. You end up emailing the same people over and over, and its all a bit ""computer says 'no'"".  I gave up the fight in the end but I will think twice about Samsung in the future.

                I bought a Samsung Galaxy Fit watch for my son in January and unfortunately the strap is about to break. I have spoken to Samsung customer services and they say that the strap is not covered in the warranty. They are happy to supply another strap at customer cost but remarkably was not able to say how much it would be.<br/>If you're happy with a watch with a life span of three months then this is definitely the watch for you. If not, might be worth avoiding Samsung.<br/><br/>Come on SAMSUNG, you are better than this surely?

                We purchased a Samsung washing machine from Curry’s on 2/11/2019. <br/>It had a error message showing on 19 April 2020 so we contacted Samsung who sent an Engineer on 24 April 2020 who could not fix it. So we had to wait for another Engineer who came yesterday who has advised the wiring loom was not clicked into the washing machine when it was manufactured. Therefore the wiring loom has sat onto of the drum and wore away the wires leaving the wires bare and a fire hazzard!!!!!<br/>The Engineer took photos and recommended a replacement washing machine this way yesterday. <br/>I have contacted Samsung who were very unhelpful and said someone would call me back - still waiting!!! <br/>The washing machine is only 4 months old!!! I am really frustrated and disappointed with their Customer ServiceDepartment  as I have not had a washer for 2 weeks and it should be a straight forward replacement.

                If I had an option then I would have chosen a 0 star for Samsung trade in scheme. I have bought a samsung note 10 phone on 3rd April 2020 and trade in my s9+ dual sim phone. <br/>Today I have received an email saying,phone display screen burn and I will have to pay £100.I have kept my phone in pristine condition and always had a cover on from day one and had No problems with it.<br/>I am happy to take s9+ back as long as they dont make it faulty. First I thought its probably a scam then quickly did research online regarding the trade in problems with screen burn issue. Samsung is ripping off everyone with the same issue and charging people £100. I feel so angry that where all the world is fighting over life in this pandemic, there are some companies just wants to take advantage and make money.

                We love Samsung. I am really not sure why all these people had issues with Samsung. Was it with Samsung direct you had dealings with or another retailer you bought the Samsung product from?<br/>In the last 2-3 weeks; we have bought 3no S20 phones and 2no Galaxy Active2 watches from Samsung direct, from their website. using the website was very easy and the orders were placed at different times and days. On all occasions the items arrived very quickly by DPD. We had to return 2no of the phones back at different times. We had no issues getting connected to an customer services agent. You just call the Samsung customer services number and you get an answer pretty quickly. They were very helpful and quickly arranged collection. The refund was made very quickly. <br/>Overall, I am very happy with all my SAmsung products at home and their customer services are really helpful, their systems are working very quickly despite the virus issue.<br/>Those, who are not happy with Samsung; are you sure this is direct with Samsung or did you buy a Samsuny product via a retailer like Currys. <br/>Before we bought any of the above, we bought a Galaxy Watch from Currys; although the delivery was pretty quick, we just could not arrange a return. We waited over two hours on the phone (Currys). Their social media pages are full of complaints. <br/>Samsung will continue to be the leading gadget manufacturer as they are the best. We love Samsung.

                Called toll number- my tv cord was taken accidentally while I disconnected my cable service and had to send in the equipment to Direct TV. ( Not my fault!). I asked if the cord could be replaced but they would not budge as I did not have my receipt.  My son bought my tv and he longer had the receipt.  They said that warehouse would never send a replacement unless I had my receipt.  They gave me the name of a company to call to buy one- I called and they wanted $99.00 plus tax for a tv replacement cord.  That seemed ridiculous to charge that much and I did not buy one.  I now have a tv that I can no longer use!  I think that in good faith they could have sent me a replacement cord - as I have purchased many Samsung products - latest was my dishwasher.  I called several times in hopes that someone could help me resolve this matter - it never happened!  DO NOT BUY anything from Samsung!  No interest in your problem once you purchase from them. Now I need to buy a new tv when a simple tv cord was all I needed.  As a customer, they don’t care about you!  Beware!!!

                Why people pay a premium over an Apple: ordered a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 arrived on time, but its operating system was broken and could not boot/charge. Asked for a replacement and this took forever until I had to ask for a refund after more than 10 days useless waiting.  The Samsung customer service is literally non-existent and they never realise their promise. They even have difficulty in tracking reference numbers and seem to have no recording system. <br/>I wish I just had read the reviews here before buying Samsung. I could easily see why people love Apple. AVOID Samsung by any means. You won't believe how careless they are treating their customers. To Samsung: you will eventually pay off a good chunk of your business by continuing to undermining your customer values! Be sure.

                They don’t even deserve one star. We paid a lot of money for our fridge-freezer, the first one arrived and the ice machine didn’t work. So after many, many phone calls (no one ever calls you back when they say they will), they tried to deliver a second one which was damaged. So we rejected it, went through the rigmarole again only to have a new one delivered and the ice machine didn’t work on it. Once again, had to phone them several times and once again they tried to deliver one that was damaged. We’re still waiting on our follow up call 6 months later, it caused us so much stress we have given up. Luckily, they did an update which miraculously fixed the ice machine. I also found out, if you fill your freezer up, it stops working. Yes, you read that right, if you utilise the space that you spent thousands of pounds on, it stops the ice machine from working. Leave it 70% full and it’s fine. It’s ridiculous. They’re a total bunch of cowboys, the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. Avoid at all costs! The hassle is just not worth it!

                I wish there was a way to leave a NO star review.  I have purchased 3, yes 3 dishwashers from this pathetic company. I should have known better after the 1 time, but I tried again and when I had to have it replaced a 2nd time, I really should've learned but money was tight and I thought there was no way it could happen a 3rd time. Basically the dishwasher has a flawed design in that it doesn't drain well, and once it overflows the water goes into the door panel, fries the sensor and then the pump doesn't shut off, even when you shut the unit off, it turns back on and continues to run thereby presenting a fire hazard. The only way to get it to shut off is unplug it. <br/>As if that wasn't bad enough, the customer service is AWFUL!! In all honesty dealing with all the customer service providers through the years they are by far the WORST! They are condescending, they placate and offer absolutely zero authentic CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Do yourself a favor and RUN from any samsung appliance unless you have lots of free time to sit on hold and wait for people to call you back or respond to emails.

I also qualified for the cash back which I was sceptical about as they told me I had info missing a couple of times to claim it back even though I got it directly through the Samsung website.  I have now however received the cash back and it took less than 30 days.  Very impressed with the service and the products.

                My french door fridge failed after 12 months. Lost all coolant. Contact Samsung in February 2020. <br/>After a 3 week wait the fridge was inspected and the inspector confirmed that it could not be repaired.<br/>This is now coming into May and i am still waiting on Samsung replacing the fridge.<br/>I have contacted Samsung on numerous occasions &gt; 30+ times. One of the last conversations was during the NZ lock down period and although Samsung acknowledged that this was classified as an essential item they would not be delivering to me until post lockdown. I called again last week in April when the announcement was made re. dropping to level 3 and was informed that no decision had been made on delivery. I have been without a fridge throughout the lockdown and this has required that i visit the stores for food on a regular basis, which was and is counter to the government guidance and instruction.  ""we are all in this together"" clearly does not apply to Samsung in New Zealand. Terrible and uncaring service.

                Got a Samsung watch and phone from EE so was eligible for Samsung cashback.  Filled in the paperwork in time, didn't hear anything but wasn't overly worried as it said could take thirty days to veriry.  I then used their track claim and it said information was missing.  I contacted them to find out what they needed, and have just received an email saying they had emailed and sent a text message saying they needed additional information from me, but because I didn't reply within 7 days, my claim had been rejected under their terms.   This is a complete fabrication as I received no text message from them or email until I contacted them.   Judging by other comments on here, Samsung appear to offering cashback that they have no intention of honouring.  I am not leaving it there and I am appalled at this kind of behaviour from such a large organisation.

It take 2-3 weeks to get the money refunded and when you call you get told it must be your fault. You must have entered the information incorrectly. If that were the case, how was I charged? The customer support is abysmal and rude. It leaves such a sour taste in my mouth, I do not even know if I will ever use them again.

I have already reported this to action fraud, police and trading standards. I am not gonna let them get away on how they treated me, I can not believe what a rubbish customer service nobody knows what they're doing. <br/><br/>I said to the advisor can I have the managers name because I am already in contact with the head office she said we can't give you our managers name and I asked can I have your name she said we can't give you our names.

                I ordered and paid for a TV £2799 directly from the Samsung website, when this arrived the TV was faulty and wouldn't switch on, so I called their customer service for a replacement to be sent. I was advised that they would need the return before they could issue a replacement. The TV was collected two days later by Panther Logistics (another bad company) and has been sat in the Panther warehouse for over a week. I chased this up with Samsung, who informed me that they need to receive the TV into their own warehouse from Panther, and then would need another 10 - 14 working days before a replacement was issued. I chased this with Panther and they said that it might be another 5 days before they ship the TV back to Samsung. So in all, we're looking at a month before I get a replacement (or so I thought.) I've since been informed by Samsung, that they have now sold out of this TV and they will issue me a refund (but still need to follow the above process.) Now to top it off, I've received an email this morning, informing me that they understand I need to return a TV and they will arrange collection. I can't imagine where my TV has ended up, or if I'll ever see my £2799 again.<br/><br/>This company is disorganised and slow at everything they do, please don't buy from them unless you can afford to throw away your hard earned cash

                I received a Samsung washing machine yesterday. Upon fitting the product it appeared to be damaged. This was notified immediately to Samsung as I’m a key worker currently employed by the ministry of defence during the Covid 19 outbreak in the uk. I require my clothes to be washed for practice as well as basic hygiene after work daily. This is an essential requirement. <br/>After discussion via messenger I was told the process was under way however I was trying get across urgency of the current situation as I don’t have means to wash my clothes without exposing my self and family to unnecessary risk. I made a follow up phone call to the customer service team this afternoon for a time frame and also clarification on the situation. The member of staff I was put through to ‘Mel’ began to laugh at me over the phone during the conversation. I find the product, service and customer service wholy unacceptable especially during this time of crisis. I am therefore requsting a full refund of the cost of goods and would not recommend Samsung to anyone. Shambles.

                My french door fridge failed after 12 months. Lost all coolant. Contact Samsung in February 2020. <br/>After a 3 week wait the fridge was inspected and the inspector confirmed that it could not be repaired.<br/>This is now coming into May and i am still waiting on Samsung replacing the fridge.<br/>I have contacted Samsung on numerous occasions &gt; 30+ times. One of the last conversations was during the NZ lock down period and although Samsung acknowledged that this was classified as an essential item they would not be delivering to me until post lockdown. I called again last week in April when the announcement was made re. dropping to level 3 and was informed that no decision had been made on delivery. I have been without a fridge throughout the lockdown and this has required that i visit the stores for food on a regular basis, which was and is counter to the government guidance and instruction.  ""we are all in this together"" clearly does not apply to Samsung in New Zealand. Terrible and uncaring service.

                Got a Samsung watch and phone from EE so was eligible for Samsung cashback.  Filled in the paperwork in time, didn't hear anything but wasn't overly worried as it said could take thirty days to veriry.  I then used their track claim and it said information was missing.  I contacted them to find out what they needed, and have just received an email saying they had emailed and sent a text message saying they needed additional information from me, but because I didn't reply within 7 days, my claim had been rejected under their terms.   This is a complete fabrication as I received no text message from them or email until I contacted them.   Judging by other comments on here, Samsung appear to offering cashback that they have no intention of honouring.  I am not leaving it there and I am appalled at this kind of behaviour from such a large organisation.

                If I could leave 0 stars I would. I have tried to order a phone bundle 4 times now with money getting charged and then as soon as the money passes my account the order is cancelled. It take 2-3 weeks to get the money refunded and when you call you get told it must be your fault. You must have entered the information incorrectly. If that were the case, how was I charged? The customer support is abysmal and rude. It leaves such a sour taste in my mouth, I do not even know if I will ever use them again. I hate that too because their products really are top of the line, but the rest of their business model sucks. 0/10 would not recommend

                I Ordered a Galaxy Buds + on April the 7th and its missing, i called Samsung customer service they said we will investigate it and get back to you.<br/><br/>No problem how long does the investigation take, Samsung call handler said 3-5 working days, called and emailed them a number of times, no reply whatsoever, everyone was given me different information, so I called after 9 working days and I have been told the investigation hasn't even started its pending. <br/><br/>So she said give me 24 hours I will get this sorted for you and ask for the manger to call me back, they said the managers working from home therefore they only communicate via email, ok no problem how long do I have to wait for your manager to email me, so another 48 hours, waited 72 hours nothing.<br/><br/>Then I called back they said we will get this resolved for you within the next 24 hours, still nothing after 48 hours.<br/><br/>Then I called back on Sunday the 19th April they please give us another 48 hours we promise we will get this sorted for you. <br/><br/>Called back today I was really fuming as I have wasted so much time on the phone to get though to them, and they answered still nothing apparently the manager hasn't even got back to their customer advisor who put the request through.<br/><br/>So I have left with no option but to dispute this case with my bank. I have already reported this to action fraud, police and trading standards. I am not gonna let them get away on how they treated me, I can not believe what a rubbish customer service nobody knows what they're doing. <br/><br/>I said to the advisor can I have the managers name because I am already in contact with the head office she said we can't give you our managers name and I asked can I have your name she said we can't give you our names. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>So please do not purchase anything from Samsung, if you have any issues the customer service horrendously terrible.

It sounds like they lost it and want to replace it but they cannot replace it because of above documentation. I refuse to buy ki samsung ever again.

                I ordered and paid for a TV £2799 directly from the Samsung website, when this arrived the TV was faulty and wouldn't switch on, so I called their customer service for a replacement to be sent. I was advised that they would need the return before they could issue a replacement. The TV was collected two days later by Panther Logistics (another bad company) and has been sat in the Panther warehouse for over a week. I chased this up with Samsung, who informed me that they need to receive the TV into their own warehouse from Panther, and then would need another 10 - 14 working days before a replacement was issued. I chased this with Panther and they said that it might be another 5 days before they ship the TV back to Samsung. So in all, we're looking at a month before I get a replacement (or so I thought.) I've since been informed by Samsung, that they have now sold out of this TV and they will issue me a refund (but still need to follow the above process.) Now to top it off, I've received an email this morning, informing me that they understand I need to return a TV and they will arrange collection. I can't imagine where my TV has ended up, or if I'll ever see my £2799 again.<br/><br/>This company is disorganised and slow at everything they do, please don't buy from them unless you can afford to throw away your hard earned cash

                I received a Samsung washing machine yesterday. Upon fitting the product it appeared to be damaged. This was notified immediately to Samsung as I’m a key worker currently employed by the ministry of defence during the Covid 19 outbreak in the uk. I require my clothes to be washed for practice as well as basic hygiene after work daily. This is an essential requirement. <br/>After discussion via messenger I was told the process was under way however I was trying get across urgency of the current situation as I don’t have means to wash my clothes without exposing my self and family to unnecessary risk. I made a follow up phone call to the customer service team this afternoon for a time frame and also clarification on the situation. The member of staff I was put through to ‘Mel’ began to laugh at me over the phone during the conversation. I find the product, service and customer service wholy unacceptable especially during this time of crisis. I am therefore requsting a full refund of the cost of goods and would not recommend Samsung to anyone. Shambles.

                Bought a brand new smart TV in April 2020, at a premium price over rivals.Only once connected did I realise BBCiPlayer is not installed, and CANNOT be installed. Called Samsung to be told “they are working on it”. Then found out this has been the case for months. How can any manufacturer sell a premium TV in the U.K. without BBC iPlayer, and have the cheek to call it a Smart TV? Have since returned it and bought an LG at 30% less and more features. This was to replace a 4 year old Samsung TV that keeps turning itself on/off at start up, so can’t be used. Found out there are hundreds with this problem, Samsung have known about it for years, but there is still no fix. Never again!

For a rather weird reasons Samsung claimed that the phones were regionally locked to protect ""Unauthorised sales"" Only God knows what they meant by that!!. phones were manufactured to be sold globally anyway, does that mean Samsung  sells  different quality of their  products to different countries or regions or what?<br/>Any way that is not even the point. requested unlock codes for the 2 phones to be used outside EU, it has taken forever for Samsung to send the unlock codes after requested purchase receipt, serial and IMEI numbers of phones were sent to them over a month. Their disjointed Customer service keeps sending confused and out of sync emails all writing gibberish echoing the same message ""your query has been escalated"". it's now getting to two months, on every enquiry the response is always the same.<br/>Samsung never seems to get anything  right these days, no wonder they are losing their customers  big time to Huawei.

                SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH ACTIVE 2 (BLUETOOTH)<br/><br/>DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY THIS WATCH!<br/><br/>I Bought this watch as a student (Bare in mind, money is tight) a few months ago and it was absolutely fine until the strap broke a few days ago. I contacted Samsung support and they sent it away. (Which I thought was stupid as they could have just sent me a new strap) anyway it arrived back and lo and behold the watch came back in the exact same state only to have been factory reset (which was just a waste of time for everyone). I then contacted Samsung Support again and they came out with the usual jargon of ""Warranty is void"" even though the order sheet I received when I got the watch back claimed that my watch was in ""Full Warranty"". So as you can probably tell, I'm not too happy and will NOT be purchasing another watch from Samsung nor another strap and will instead be purchasing a Fitbit as my next smart watch as their support is far more useful, not the mention the fact that they actually want to help, unlike Samsung. So my advice for you if you're thinking of purchasing this watch, DON'T DO IT! Save yourself the torture and just buy a Garmin or a Fitbit for half the price. Once again thanks to Samsung for the lack of help. :)

I’ve reported this and am now being fobbed off and told that I didn’t register to extend my warranty from two years. When I look at my purchase from AO.com and my receipt it simply displays the 5 year warranty and no mention of having to apply for this, but Samsung are using it as an excuse not to repair it. <br/><br/>So in these time of facing financial difficulty and when we need to shop as little as possible (which requires a working fridge and freezer) I am left with no fridge freezer and no support from Samsung. <br/><br/>Unacceptable for such a large company who should be looking after their loyal customers right now. <br/><br/>Thank you Samsung.

                Tried to contact Samsung Smart Things for a replacement of their ""SmartThings"" Button. Live Chat transferred me to a wrong live chat department which transferred me back to the same agent before who eventually told me to call Samsung Smart Things. Then the Smart Things person told me he only deals with tech support and not warranty (while the voice recording says warranty info) and then he transferred me to 3 different people who didn't know what they were doing. One person didn't even know what a ""Smart Things"" button was and I had to offer him to google the model number. After I gave him the model number he still didn't know what it was. <br/><br/>I think Samsung should probably rename their products dumb things. <br/><br/>NEVER BUY FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN.

                I purchased the samsung S20 and also traded my S9 in for £250 off the cost of the phone.<br/>I sent the phone to them in perfect condition,my phone had always had a screen protector on and was in a case.<br/>This week samsung emailed me to say phone faulty it has what they call screen burn, i dispute this as as stated was sent in perfect condition they are now asking for £100 which i think is disgraceful,i contacted samsung to say my S9 was still under warranty to which i was told this problem not covered, i think its just one big scam from sansung and i won't  use them or recommend them again,i also tried to reason with them also due to covid 19 i have no income at minute but they didnt care.

                I ordered a Samsung washer and dryer from home Depot, but washer was leaking the day I got it. When I called for replacement or asking a technician to come over to check out the machine. It took forever to get in touch with someone. Even I was able to talk to someone, I kept getting disconnected and I have to call them back again and again. I have been repeating this process for a week now. It's very frustrating and the issue hasn't got resolved and none of the representative was able to help. I can't believe I have to deal with this whole thing in order to find out what I can do with a new washer that was leaking the first day I got it! (The washer model# is WF45R6100AW/US). Btw, the dryer's door was broken as well when it first got delivered but fortunately it got replaced. <br/><br/>Also, I think there is a really bad communication between home Depot and Samsung because I can't get this issue addressed to home Depot directly, that's why I have to call the Samsung myself. And I'm talking about we reported the leaking problem literally the day we got the machine.<br/><br/>My advice, try to avoid purchasing big items like home appliances from home Depot and if they are Samsung.

I pre ordered the s20 ultra to get the earbuds, but I forgot to apply the employee discount. I tried to explain this to them, but they say it can't be applied to the previous order and I need to send back the already delivered phone and order a new one and then I won't get the earbuds. What unfair treatment is this, no respect for the customer...

                Samsung RS50N3513WW RS3000 with Plumbed Water &amp; Ice American fridge freezer<br/>This Product is expensive so you would expect it to work. It apparently has a common fault to do with a build up of ice causing the fan to become noisy, I mean NOISY. It was repaired last year 6 months after purchase. but went again 3 weeks ago. After reporting it, it took a week for an engineer to call out,He arrived took one look and said it needs new parts (an upgrade) . that took another week !. A week later the engineer fitted the new parts, left, and with in 10 minutes the noise came back. <br/>I immediately called the engineer who couldn't call back. I then called samsung, its been another week. Apparently they are not taking calls only internet chat due to the virus?. After I finally got through I now have to wait another week before an engineer can call out. To make matters worse my wife is a Nurse, she is unable to sleep properly so is helping fight against the virus with little sleep....................thank you samsung for your poor service over the last 4 weeks.

                Beware of the Cashback Offer.     Bought a new Samsung phone through Sky and promised £100 cashback within 30 days.  30 days been and gone.  Sky will not respond to questions, and Samsung tell me to wait an extra 14 days due to the cronovirus and exceptional sales.  None of this my problem, I bought the item in good faith from Sky and even the CEO will not respond to numerous complaints about this.  Samsung just send a standard email which they must send to everyone.  Told me to wait 10-14 days and if not received to get back in touch with them.<br/><br/>SKY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF NOT RESPONDING AND DEALING WITH THIS COMPANY

                If I could give zero stars I would.<br/>I brought the s20 With trade in for my s8 as a preorder and I received it on time. After 5 days it would not turn on and would not work . I contacted Samsung and they had said I can get a replacement they booked a collection for my device and nobody came to collect it, which wasted all my time for that day. I had then decided to drop it off at the pickup stores and once Samsung record my s20 they cancelled the replacement device I was supposed to receive even though I was told by an advisor that the replacement was ready to ship as soon as they received the faulty device. I contacted Samsung over a hundred times using different methods and got no where. Not a single person at Samsung could tell me why it was cancelled until I went through ceo channel and heard it was cancelled because it was out of stock. Also, now it has been over 1week for me without a phone. Samsung don’t seem to care I asked them to send any s20 or the ultra I am happy with it to pay. But they can’t do that. Also, they said they will refund me which they still have not done and to top it off they have my s8 which they said they will try to get back for me and they will contact. Which they have not. Samsung shop staff ok the phone are really incompetent and really don’t know what they are doing as this is a simple problem they have made it 10x worse themselves. <br/><br/>I have contacted Samsung and I had spoke to James who told me that he would sort out getting my s8 back or they will pay the value of it and they will give me compensation. Guess what he said he would call me back and I have not heard anything. To top it off I called Samsung today to tell them about this and I was speaking was speaking to a James and I told him we both spoke previously which he denied, but I’m not stupid Samsung I can tel he was the same advisor by his voice and he did also slip up saying we did speak and he then cut the phone by telling me he was putting me on hold. Also, Samsung are so incompetent that they have sent me an email for a return of my s20 when they have already received the s20.<br/><br/>Samsung have wasted sooo much of my time and wasted my money on a new device I pre ordered and they cannot even rectify the problem. <br/><br/>Samsung claims all calls are recorded soo please listen to them I have all the transcripts from my email chats and the call history’s.<br/><br/>Update: <br/><br/>Finally received an update in regard to this matter. Samsung has issued the refund for my device but have not refunded it as of yet and in the course of this I have to purchase a knew s20. To top it off samsung is willing to give me a £50 voucher to compensate me for this matter. Still awaiting for my refund. Worst experience ever.

                I saw that Samsung were offering £100 off a new S10 when you trade in a Galaxy S7 (based on good condition, which it is), so I went for it. Three weeks into owning my S10, I received an email from Samsung saying I had to pay a £50 fee as my S7 had screen burn, which is half of the trade in value gone. I have pictures of the S7 taken right before I packed it up to be sent off, and no screen burn can be seen in these pictures, but the best I've had from Samsung is ""You can have your S7 back for £100"".<br/><br/>This feels like such a shoddy sales tactic to me, to offer people a good trade in price to get them to commit to the purchase of a new phone, only to refuse to honour that trade in price down the line and try to impose a fee. Be very careful if you use their trade in service. I'm done with Samsung.

                Pre ordered 2 s20+ phones and clear view covers on 15th Feb with delivery expected to be 10th March.  On delivery package arrived by DPD and I signed for it not knowing the contents.  When opened we had oly received 1 phone and 1 cover in the box and note said 2 packages so then began the arduous process of getting Samsung to understand our situation as we kept getting in various messages the the order had been delivered that there seem to be some suspicion that we were on it.  Finally they accepted that the other half of the order was missing and they would have to investigate it and then yesterday we got a message to say that the phone and cover would be returned to stock and we would get a refund. Fine i thought but no explanation of what had happened and the suspicion was off us.  Refund happened so I reordered a replacement which came this morning and on opening the box found it had a damaged screen so whole return process started again.  Very angry at the moment for such poor service.

                After years of buying Sony I was seduced into a curved screen tv. I went for the best with 3D. Four years the back light has gone and it went onto the repair shop on Tuesday under the 6 year warranty. After two days I’m told it will be fixed but they need authority to do so but on following this up I am told the screen is no longer available so great news I will be offered a new tv. However 5he replacement will take 4 to 6 weeks. I ring them up and it’s all my fault as I agreed to the terms and conditions. I ask for sight of these conditions and how I agreed and that is refused. I’m told they have agreed to replace but the offer of replacement will take 3 to 5 working days. How can it take that long? I’m an old fellow and staying indoors to avoid this renegade virus and without my television it seems interminable. They refuse to supply a loan tv and really don’t care.<br/>I this a truly awful customer care as their product failed within a very short time being very poorly made.

Samsung wouldn't honor their mistake. They accepted that they delivered the incorrect item, but they refuse to resend the correct item because they said the date was past time. I explained to them the reason being that I bought the bundle early for my builder would have everything in place when he was ready to install.  Once he installed I visited the site and immediately noticed it was the wrong item. I called Samsung and 1 customer service gentlemen said he would rectify the mistake and send the correct item. The item was on back order so he say. I called back several times about the ETA of the cooktop. They then say its past the return time. So I went back and forth with several supervisors. They all are horrible and unprofessional.  My household has 6 Samsung phones. All will be turned in to Verizon and Sprint today. And we will use APPLE from this day forth.

                Pre ordered 2 s20+ phones and clear view covers on 15th Feb with delivery expected to be 10th March.  On delivery package arrived by DPD and I signed for it not knowing the contents.  When opened we had oly received 1 phone and 1 cover in the box and note said 2 packages so then began the arduous process of getting Samsung to understand our situation as we kept getting in various messages the the order had been delivered that there seem to be some suspicion that we were on it.  Finally they accepted that the other half of the order was missing and they would have to investigate it and then yesterday we got a message to say that the phone and cover would be returned to stock and we would get a refund. Fine i thought but no explanation of what had happened and the suspicion was off us.  Refund happened so I reordered a replacement which came this morning and on opening the box found it had a damaged screen so whole return process started again.  Very angry at the moment for such poor service.

                Ordered a new phone, took my money. Can't give me a delivery time. Or an actual viable excuse to where it is. Promise a call back, never do.<br/><br/>Will never purchase from them directly again.

                Very bad customer service and no customer care policy at Westfield Stratford Samsung Store. I gave my phone for repair and I was told it would be ready the next day maximum. However, I kept calling every day - no one bothered to update me on why my phone was not ready. After 5 days when I called they said it was ready for collection.

                I purchased a 55 in tv after 14 months the screen started flickering, I found out the chip on the main board was recalled 4 years ago but they are still using them on newer models, I purchased an s8+ and after 18 months the charger in the phone would not charge correctly, the customer service is horrible

                After years of buying Sony I was seduced into a curved screen tv. I went for the best with 3D. Four years the back light has gone and it went onto the repair shop on Tuesday under the 6 year warranty. After two days I’m told it will be fixed but they need authority to do so but on following this up I am told the screen is no longer available so great news I will be offered a new tv. However 5he replacement will take 4 to 6 weeks. I ring them up and it’s all my fault as I agreed to the terms and conditions. I ask for sight of these conditions and how I agreed and that is refused. I’m told they have agreed to replace but the offer of replacement will take 3 to 5 working days. How can it take that long? I’m an old fellow and staying indoors to avoid this renegade virus and without my television it seems interminable. They refuse to supply a loan tv and really don’t care.<br/>I this a truly awful customer care as their product failed within a very short time being very poorly made. However I have to carry the loss as I was stupid enough to believe their marketing

                I will never purchase anything from Samsung again. I purchased a entire kitchen appliances setup. My cooktop was not the correct cooktop I ordered. Samsung wouldn't honor their mistake. They accepted that they delivered the incorrect item, but they refuse to resend the correct item because they said the date was past time. I explained to them the reason being that I bought the bundle early for my builder would have everything in place when he was ready to install.  Once he installed I visited the site and immediately noticed it was the wrong item. I called Samsung and 1 customer service gentlemen said he would rectify the mistake and send the correct item. The item was on back order so he say. I called back several times about the ETA of the cooktop. They then say its past the return time. So I went back and forth with several supervisors. They all are horrible and unprofessional.  My household has 6 Samsung phones. All will be turned in to Verizon and Sprint today. And we will use APPLE from this day forth. As for our basement and guest quarters. We will not use any Samsung Appliances.  I wanted all Samsung. But as of today we will use any other brand. That's a total of 16 Appliances that was going to be Samsung but not anymore. I also will make sure I share with everyone not to use Samsung anything.  If they ask I will make sure they read all the reviews.

It was not possible...my order was not recognised! I tried via live chat..no! I rang...(the auto options didn't respond to my keypad). I emailed...I did live chat...again. I rang yet again.....I was told to refuse order on delivery! Basically.. there is NO option to cancel order before dispatch, and no help whatsoever.Do not buy anything from this company, as you will be stuck if you have any issues down the line!

                Samsung UK, managed by PRS, is the worst company ever. When I was trying to get a finance to buy a new phone I was told by Samsung Store staff in Edinburgh that it's only available for British or those with UK driving licence. Why not to put a banner outside ""Only for Britons"" like in a Germany in 1930s? Discriminating and humiliating practices, leaving huge group of people ( majority of immigrants) without access to financial services. Who would be their next target?

                After getting no positive reply from several calls to Samsung and a formal complaint with them after they recommended Unique Repair Service in Indianapolis, In. as an authorized repair service for my dryer. The technician came and gave a diagnostic that it needed a new motor at a cost with labor of almost $500.00. They charged $109.00 for the diagnostic. Long story short-I called another repair service and the motor was fine, the dryer had nothing wrong with it. It was a blown fuse. I asked the Unique Repair Service for my money back for a completely false diagnostic and for trying to get me to pay a  high repair bill. They told me as soon as they make a house-call they charge whether they do anything or not. I then contacted Samsung because they have Unique as their authorized service repairs service and believe Samsung is responsible for them. After making a formal complaint and hours on the phone and a negative response from Samsung, they leave me no choice than to believe they don't care about their customers, therefore giving them a one star rating.

Made the fatal mistake of waiting for a builder / handyman to come over and mount the TV before opening it and he kept on postponing. Opened it for the first time on Friday 28th February and it was put up on the wall immediately and was working fine.  TV still has all the plastic on the frame and not a mark on it (also verified by Samsung via their app which allows them to view the TV through your phone). Thurs 5th March while listening to spotify the screen goes black. No picture, no sound after 6 days! This has to be a joke! Contacted Samsung and of course because it is out of the 28 day refund window (purchased from Argos) my only option is to get a repair. <br/><br/>If for arguments sake I had started using the TV as soon as I purchased it on the 28th of December, again why would I want a TV that has packed up within the first two months of use?! Very disappointing.  <br/>More annoyed at myself for waiting for the builder and not opening the TV straight away. but who expects a brand new TV to pack up after just six days???<br/><br/>Will be interesting to see how this repair turns out...

                Beware of Samsung Cashback promotions, they'll do anything to get out of paying. First they said that the documents I had uploaded had insufficient information. They were all John Lewis receipts and VAT receipts and contained all the information their terms and conditions specified. Finally a promotions representative validated the claim after numerous further document uploads which I asked John Lewis to provide (confirmed by email). Then a further rep phoned to say that the first rep had no authority to validate the claim and they were now declining the claim. And they've come up with a new reason - I'm out of time! I'm out of time because of Samsung. The original TV was faulty and returned after 20 days and a rep told me that the 30 day window to claim would begin 30 days after the replacement TV was ordered (there will be a recording of this). Now another rep is telling me that the claim should have been made within 30 days of the original purchase, so you're out of time mate! I am fighting this crowd with everything I have and will be taking advice. Even if I succeed I will never ever buy a Samsung product again and I will do my level best to make sure nobody else does.<br/><br/>NB: Subsequent to making the above post, Samsung have come back and acknowledged that they have made a mistake and have now validated my claim. However, I have not changed my view of this company. They have caused me so much stress and distress.

                Really disappointed with the Galaxy phone I purchased last year. Never have I ever dropped a phone where the screen just smashes into a million tiny pieces the first time - surely they should not be allowed to sell phones that are not capable of withstanding normal wear and tear?! I've had this just under six months and it was immaculate until I dropped it! <br/>And prior to the screen smashing, I have to say the touch screen was really slow and unresponsive most of the time. This phone is not worth the money and the camera on it isn't great either, I believe it's a galaxy j3? Will stick to Sony in future. Not impressed Samsung! Looked nice but not a practical purchase even for those of us who take good care of things!

                I recently purchased new Buds Plus Headphones directly from Samsung official website. <br/>I really got a shock how poor and unflexible is their delivery service ( even you are willing to pay extra )<br/>You can choose next day delivery ( or any day except from weekend, how ,,helpful,,) delivery from DPD all day or pay £3.99 and choose time slot. Time slots are really ridiculous. It is up to 10 30 am or up to 12 pm or after 12 pm. ????<br/>Did ever Samsung hear about people who are going to work???<br/>Most of working people leaving homes around 8am and coming home after 5-6 pm.<br/>There is not option for evening delivery. Well what you can excpect from DPD.<br/>I spoke with sale department and they say I could choose to pick up from their nearest pick up point.<br/>Well when I received tracking number I found out Samsung do not bother to pay DPD to add that options. So even you are willing to upgrade and pay, any option of collection from pick up point or leave it with neighborough or change delivery address is out ot plate.<br/>So I spend £159 for expensive earphones and Samsung has no decency to provide proper delivery service.

                My loyalty for Samsung and android is hanging by a mere thread. I have 2 Samsung Galaxy Note 9 devices. I paid over $1,000 each! To be forced to get the latest android 10 update was a terrible idea. At first the update hid all of my music, then i go to edit a video and now it crashes. I paid money to no longer be able to use my editor. Also this phone can barely even run Chrome before it crashes. I also used the S pen to edit pictures and <br/>now the color grab is missing. What i mean by color grab is being able to choose a color from any picture and be able to write with that particular color. Now we are forced to only use the basic colors provided in the app. I don't know what is going on at Samsung  but it needs to be fix soon before i switch over to Microsoft or even Apple.

                Beware of Samsung Cashback promotions, they'll do anything to get out of paying. First they said that the documents I had uploaded had insufficient information. They were all John Lewis receipts and VAT receipts and contained all the information their terms and conditions specified. Finally a promotions representative validated the claim after numerous further document uploads which I asked John Lewis to provide (confirmed by email). Then a further rep phoned to say that the first rep had no authority to validate the claim and they were now declining the claim. And they've come up with a new reason - I'm out of time! I'm out of time because of Samsung. The original TV was faulty and returned after 20 days and a rep told me that the 30 day window to claim would begin 30 days after the replacement TV was ordered (there will be a recording of this). Now another rep is telling me that the claim should have been made within 30 days of the original purchase, so you're out of time mate! I am fighting this crowd with everything I have and will be taking advice. Even if I succeed I will never ever buy a Samsung product again and I will do my level best to make sure nobody else does.<br/><br/>NB: Subsequent to making the above post, Samsung have come back and acknowledged that they have made a mistake and have now validated my claim. However, I have not changed my view of this company. They have caused me so much stress and distress.

                S9 Plus phone had an issue with water detected on the charge port. <br/>The phone had not been near water at all. <br/><br/>Contact Samsung, and the rep was really good, showed understanding, and arrange the phone to be fixed under warranty at a local Samsung store the very next day. <br/><br/>Took my phone to Samsung Store (best to make an appointment to guarantee time slot) and a Samsung Rep carried out a few tests and then booked the phone in to be fixed. <br/>At this point i was expecting to be without a phone for a couple of days. <br/>Surprised that she told me it could be fixed within a few hours, or at the latest the following day. <br/>Received a text a few hours later to say the repair had been completed and my phone was ready to be picked up. <br/><br/>Wow. this is the level of service I expect in this day of age from a company of its statue. Very good.

                Really disappointed with the Galaxy phone I purchased last year. Never have I ever dropped a phone where the screen just smashes into a million tiny pieces the first time - surely they should not be allowed to sell phones that are not capable of withstanding normal wear and tear?! I've had this just under six months and it was immaculate until I dropped it! <br/>And prior to the screen smashing, I have to say the touch screen was really slow and unresponsive most of the time. This phone is not worth the money and the camera on it isn't great either, I believe it's a galaxy j3? Will stick to Sony in future. Not impressed Samsung! Looked nice but not a practical purchase even for those of us who take good care of things!

                I recently purchased new Buds Plus Headphones directly from Samsung official website. <br/>I really got a shock how poor and unflexible is their delivery service ( even you are willing to pay extra )<br/>You can choose next day delivery ( or any day except from weekend, how ,,helpful,,) delivery from DPD all day or pay £3.99 and choose time slot. Time slots are really ridiculous. It is up to 10 30 am or up to 12 pm or after 12 pm. ????<br/>Did ever Samsung hear about people who are going to work???<br/>Most of working people leaving homes around 8am and coming home after 5-6 pm.<br/>There is not option for evening delivery. Well what you can excpect from DPD.<br/>I spoke with sale department and they say I could choose to pick up from their nearest pick up point.<br/>Well when I received tracking number I found out Samsung do not bother to pay DPD to add that options. So even you are willing to upgrade and pay, any option of collection from pick up point or leave it with neighborough or change delivery address is out ot plate.<br/>So I spend £159 for expensive earphones and Samsung has no decency to provide proper delivery service.

                My loyalty for Samsung and android is hanging by a mere thread. I have 2 Samsung Galaxy Note 9 devices. I paid over $1,000 each! To be forced to get the latest android 10 update was a terrible idea. At first the update hid all of my music, then i go to edit a video and now it crashes. I paid money to no longer be able to use my editor. Also this phone can barely even run Chrome before it crashes. I also used the S pen to edit pictures and <br/>now the color grab is missing. What i mean by color grab is being able to choose a color from any picture and be able to write with that particular color. Now we are forced to only use the basic colors provided in the app. I don't know what is going on at Samsung  but it needs to be fix soon before i switch over to Microsoft or even Apple.

                Useless! Bought a Samsung TV at christmas. Thought i was buying a good make - already broken. Customer service based in Asia somewhere, the most painful conversation trying to actually get through to the point where an engineer would come out and look. Eventually managed to book in a slot - told them we could only do the following Monday, then received a confirmation email for Friday. Had to call again and change to Monday.  Monday comes, I have taken a day holiday and the engineer is apparently sick. Can't offer me any other times apart from Monday-Friday 9-5 (i work full time) and couldn't offer me any other solution, disappointing given the fact they are the ones cancelling. Not helpful when most people work full time. Will not be buying from Samsung again, very disappointed.

                Long story short. My phone ONE PLUS 7 PRO is in service at the moment. So I opened my bed side drawer and get out my old samsung grand prime phone. I do not want to waste my time to setup the phone so I just press a factory reset to clear all data. I planned to use this just a simple phone, i do not want to install anything. I put my sim card in the phone and it is asking me about a GOOGLE ACCOUNT. Which i do not want to use it. I do not need GOOGLE or facebook on this phone and I already have no idea which account was on the phone earlier. So after factory reset I realize I can not use the phone as a phone without login to GOOGLE ACCOUNT. I asked samsung support what to do now? This was the out come: <br/>This is a Google security feature and cannot be cancelled unless you are able to remove the Google account before resetting. <br/>So this means GOOGLE TAKE POWER OVER samsung. Without GOOGLE ACCOUNT OR CONTROL you are not able to use you own phone as a phone. I would like to know what law says about all of this. samsung factory installed a third party software on every device which can make your device completly unusable. <br/>GOOGLE FACTORY PROTECTION LOCK. BIG GOOGLE TAKE CONTROLL OVER YOU and tiny samsung. WHAT A SHAME IS THIS FOR tiny samsung. What a joke is samsung?

                Possibly the worst company for customer service.<br/>I bought my first ""smart"" TV from Samsung through John Lewis.<br/>Despite early niggles with the stand not fitting, it worked well for a few weeks.<br/>Then the trouble started. It has a record to HDD facility which was one of the attractions. Gradually, it deteriorated from being able to schedule recording, to not being able to record unless you were watching the programme. The bog standard support came up with stuff like factory resetting with all the grief that causes after you've set up i-player etc.<br/>Nothing worked and it just went on with their support churning out the same rubbish.<br/>Then I tried ""President Office Escalations"" - yes that was the name - hoping to get a result.<br/>Nothing. Three years later the only advice I got was delete all the recordings and try again. Delete all the recordings??? What the ****. That's what I bought it for, you foolish people (edited for Trust Pilot).<br/>A load of rubbish about their AV team working on it. More likely doing crosswords.<br/>A bit of research showed that this was a known problem, but either Samsung can't use Google search, or they don't like bad news.<br/>This Presidents Office stuff is a sham. It's the same crummy support people who couldn't care less and once any of their products are more than a month old, they move onto the next project like how to fold your phone in half or start a fire in your pocket. The trouble with Samsung is that they have too many sticky little fingers in too many pies and can't tell a washing machine from a TV.<br/>President Donald ""Duck"" Trump knows more about TVs than Mr President Sumsung.<br/>As soon as this TV is old enough to dump it, then that's what will happen.<br/>Samsung ain't no Rolls Royce and it shows. You might just as well buy the cheapest brand of Chinese TV and save a load of dosh.<br/>By buying Samsung, you are probably buying Chinese anyway, so just cut the middleman out.<br/>Even the Samsung computer monitor is rubbish. No VESA mount, fiddly controls and annoying pop-up menus. Needless to say, the other two are LG

I explain the particulars to Samsung but apparently there not the best technicians/customer care, because  I had time sensitiv matters pending I had to take my SSD to a computer Shop and have it fixed the right the first time.

The problems started we were away for several weeks and it would not let us register for the insurance it kept saying on both of our devices imei not recognised we could not contact Samsung because of the type of number we were calling . So on our first chance calling them we did unfortunately we were over the 30 days time limit you needed to register.  The very unhelpful girl on the end of the phone said tough luck I totally understand but we will not give your insurance to you . We have a samsung fridge cost £4500 7 samsung TVs  and over 20 samsung phones within our business.  Unless samsung read this and fix our free insurance I WILL NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN

                buying from samsung shop direct is the worst retail experience I have ever come across. customer service is a complete shambles and embarrassment, completely devoid of any common sense or communication ability.<br/><br/>Product took a week to arrive, arrived damaged, and was offered a replacement that could only be processed once the damaged unit was received back into their warehouse, meaning it would take another 12-16 days to receive a replacement. all in all, 3 weeks from order date to receive an £850 product is not acceptable. I was literally able to cancel the order, and go on to a local electrical website and order a different unit with a 2 day delivery slot, for £150 cheaper.<br/><br/>Complete waste of time and effort.

                Amazing service and free TV repair from Samsung for my seven year old Smart TV when its Smarthub stopped working, meaning that I could not access any apps or on-demand TV (e.g. iplayer, Netflix).  As I had already tried every option on my menu, including a full factory reset, and followed the instructions for my error message on both the Samsung website and various internet forums, I did not hold out much hope that it could be fixed.  One half hour phone call to Samsung later and the helpful Samsung lady in the Philippines had repaired my TV remotely free of charge.

The vibration is like it's going to explode. This has been happening since the start of December we are on the 22nd February 2020. Still not solved. They have sent out 7 engineers only one engineer changed the entire inside. Yet the problem.was not solved hence I have had so many engineers sent out after that. I don't see how they can not solve the problem. Now they want to send out the 8th engineer. 3months later I'm still having the problem. Never buy anything from them. The last 2 engineers have said no fault found. So I was asked to send a 2minute video of what I'm experiencing as of I'm lying. Rude! I have done this and yet they still want 8th engineer sent out. It costs them more to send all these engineers out. I just want my money back they can take the washing machine I do not want it. Ridiculous service so not professional you'd think it being such a huge international company they would beable to solve the problem instantly. <br/>I have a elderly lady, a toddler and a new born due in a couple of weeks in need of a washing machine. This machine has packed on on me twice. I'm having to go laundrette no compensation. I'm having to take time off work for there engineers to attend which is ridiculous.

                We bought an 82” TV and it is junk, and Samsung is terrible at backing up their brand. Within six month of purchase, screen would fade to blank very frequently.  We called service, it took two visits to fix that problem but the repair caused a new problem, a horizontal pixel line across the screen. We’ve now had four repair visits and each time the repairman cannot fix it.  Each time we call, they say they want to try To fix it again.    At the last visit they said they would replace the TV, but now they want to come out ONE MORE TIME.   We will not give up, nor would we ever purchase or recommend anything made by Samsung.

Took me over 10 calls to the support center, pick up day was allocated, so waited whole day at home on that day and no one turned up, no notification of the pick up happening was sent (despite being promised), took me ages to rearrange, once rearranged no notification of the pick up was ever sent to me. Finally the collection people turned up and just walked in took the tele and drove off, did not answer anything about if they work for Samsung or if they have any paperwork. Support centre is like in the stone age, people sometimes barely speak english, generally do not quite understand questions and ask crazy number of security questions everytime

                Probably the worst customer experience…<br/>Probably the worst customer experience I have ever had from the Samsung promoted and approved mobile phone repair service from WeFix<br/>The Samsung website offered an approved phone repair service, which I thought was Samsung provided. It turned out to be provided by WeFix, but as it was Samsung approved, I expected a smart approach with great customer service. However, this wasn’t how it turned out. I have had some shocking customer experiences in my time, but this one takes the biscuit. My warning to potential customers is that you need to ensure you fit without the specific way this service works, otherwise you will be out of pocket. I am £59 out of pocket and still have a broken phone as I refused to accept the additional charges. WeFix processed a refund, however they refused to refund the full booking fee. I will be taking this complaint further through other channels on principle. I believe others will have been hit by these hidden and disproportioned charges, that were caused by their own poor systems and processes.<br/>The problem with their experience occurs when you place a booking for a repair. You can only pick a day and there is no flexibility to select a time slot or even a morning or afternoon slot. They inform you that they will contact you on the day to tell you what time the engineer will arrive. Most companies that don't have the systems to offer time slots then give you flexibility to change the slot or call you in the morning to make sure the slot is suitable. You only get informed at 8am on the day of the repair, so If the slot is not suitable then it doesn’t give you a lot of time to plan. As I booked the repair on the 6/2/2020 for the repair to take place on the 11/2/2020 they had plenty of time in advance to inform me of the time slot. As soon as I received the slot I rang them when their call centre opened at 9am to ask for a different slot. I was told that I could only move the slot if I pay £59 on top of the repair cost. The slot they gave me fell right at the time of the school pickup and I had no time to rearrange. Their website made clear in the terms and conditions (only visible after the booking was made) that I would be charged for changing the booking time. However, it didn’t make clear that I would not be able to pick a suitable timeslot in the first place. They did not make it clear that they will automatically select a timeslot. I believe WeFix imposes hidden charges on customers and makes disproportioned and unreasonable charges for making changes to bookings.<br/>To further exacerbate my frustration with this poor customer experience I sent WeFix two complaints through their website and one via Twitter. I have not received a response from them apart from sending me an invite to provide a review on TrustPilot. So being the good customer that I am I have kindly provided some feedback. I hope this feedback can help potential customers navigate the pitfalls of the way their systems and processes work. I also hope that it helps WeFix to improve how they work and consider a more customer centric approach to the way they work. I think its great that a UK company is offering this kind of service and that they have managed to land a contract with Samsung to be their approved supplier. The trouble is, they are unlikely to keep hold of this contract if they don’t improve how they work. I have read the other reviews on TrustPilot and many are very positive, particularly with the engineers, so it’s a shame that they are let down by other parts of the service.

                Absolutely shocking customer service i have to say.<br/>The 1st courier service they assigned to pick my phone up never turned up so they changed to a different service provider namely dpd after about 3 days! <br/>Be very careful when you send your phone off for repair and film the dpd driver as he opens the box to take a photo of the phone, as he dropped mine and deneyed it.<br/>I then get a call from Samsung saying the wanted £230 from me to fix the screen before they could fix my faulty charge port, the phone didn't have a scratch on it when i handed it over.<br/>Between samsung and dpd they failed to agree liability and i had to claim off my insurance and pay an excess.<br/>No help at all from Samsung after the courier service they use broke my phone and left me without a phone for 3 weeks!<br/>I have had near every galaxy s model that they have released but Never again will i buy a samsung product!

                Samsung are probably the worst company I have ever had to deal with. My washing machine has been broken since November with a burning smell to it. They sent an engineer who advised that the machine should be replaced which they refused and stated that it should be repaired and I am still waiting for someone to contact me on 17.02.2020 (February). I have rung them and they have the most UNPROFESSIONAL agency you can deal with. I have had the phone hung up on me, I have been placed on hold and no one returns, I have a case reference number which I give them but is useless because I have to explain everything from the beginning every time. This washer dryer has had faults from the time of purchase but they told me that I should reset it with them over the phone, which I did and they said the problems should resolve themselves over time (twice). When I challenged this later they said “oh 4 weeks has now lapsed so you cannot return it to the store you bought it from and will have to let us try and resolve the matter. Almost a year on they are still trying to resolve it and they rub it in that the policy states that they can do so up to 5 times” but they are stretching these 5 times out for their benefit in my view. They send someone who just comes and ‘tinkers’ then they disappear and I can’t get anything done in between. Meanwhile I am just waiting for my house to burn down if I use it as advised or go to the launderette for safety when I have a machine at home.

                I am normally a great fan of John Lewis &amp; Partners, but recent events have made me re-think that!<br/><br/>There appears to be a large number of Samsung customers experiencing the same issue with their TVs as myself. That being, large purple patches developing on the screen which cannot be repaired, in some cases as soon as 2 years after purchasing. The only solution being to have the screen replaced at an unviable cost. Samsung are making no acknowledgement of the level of complaints about this issue, which, with the volume of posts on numerous noticeboards, can only be the result of a manufacturing or design issue.<br/><br/>I also have this ‘Purple Patch’ issue with my 5 year old Samsung UE50H6400, purchased from John Lewis. So I am outside of their 5 year warranty, but still within the 6 year claim period of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. I called John Lewis to discuss my intention to pursue a claim on this basis and they came back to me with the suggestion that if I paid the £105.00 call out charge for a Samsung engineer to confirm that my TV was “either inherently faulty or unrepairable”, then John Lewis would be able to settle my claim to the sum of £22.20. CHECKMATE!

                Liars and scammers<br/><br/>Hi Trading standings,<br/>This complain is about Samsung rolling out corrupt update to a phone software which wouldn't allow customers to connect to a third party electrical equipment.<br/>In my case, I am connecting my samsung mobile phone to my panasonic tv.<br/>I have chased them for 3 weeks and all they have caused more and more problems. First they blocked my email address purposely then I started chasing them for solution from another address and Finally I submitted an email to CEO upon which I had some response. Samsung reprensetantive Sean booked a repair.<br/>The repair technician who came to my home was able to connect his Samsung phone to my Panasonic tv but because of there corrupt update I can't connect mine which he himself accept that it's a phone software malfunctions.<br/>I performed all the steps which they asked me to do including factory reset which I wasn't willing to do originally but there repair technician corrupted the phone further due to which we cant use the phone any more because it went on boot loop/restarting .<br/>Samsung is purposely crashing customer connection with other 3rd party devices so that they have to buy there TVs.<br/>I want Samsung to compensate for all the stress they have cause and sort the features which they purposely corrupted on latest android 10 update. ALL THE PICTURES WITH MY NEW BORN FOR LAST 15 MONTHS ARE GONE. ALL my bank account login IDs they are gone<br/><br/><br/>It's not the case that Samsung hasn't done this malpractice previously. THey have also been previously accused of similar malpractices where they were penalised.<br/><br/>Hopefully, some in UK regulatory body will going to take action against them.<br/>I am happy to file a case against them in the small county court if required.<br/>Regards<br/>Muhammad

                Battery on my Samsung Watch failed. I was told I had to book an appointment so that someone could tell me it had failed. Only then could I book it in for repair. I was slightly late for my appointment, so they cancelled it. Told me I had to book another appointment. I just walked out.<br/>Customer Service means providing a service to your customers, not expecting your customers to arrange their whole week around your representatives. You are not that important.<br/>Not a problem anymore. No longer a Samsung customer.

                Bought their TV about two years ago. The TV screen has been flickering and acting up since last year but not often. As it still within the warranty, I sent a video clip to show the customer service what the issue is. Returned my TV at the repair centre for further assessment and repair.<br/><br/>Apparently they didn't find any issue. They claim it as no fault but cannot explain why the TV screen was flickering. Nothing was fixed, no repair was carried out. Receiving my FAULTY TV back. Completely waste of time. Ask the customer service what to do if this happened again or outside warranty. Their reply was to contact them again and see what they can do.<br/><br/>DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A FAULT THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM NOR FIX IT!<br/><br/>GOOD LUCK

And when I arrived I was told this was just to join a queue ha the person before me had left without leaving his devise as he couldn’t get his head around their system within two minutes they had lost about 400 pounds of business can’t see this store lasting too long and to top it off the repair department is just a franchise lots of tec equipment and rubbish service so don’t bother going there

                Wouldn’t even give this company one star. Low quality tv’s and the worst customer service i’ve experienced. I bought a 65” tv online and it had a line down the tv within a month. I called samsung and they offered a return and said they’d booked the delivery in. I rang up and they said the delivery was never booked in so it couldn’t be collected, so i booked it in again and received a text notification and they arranged it for the WRONG day so i had to rearrange again! In all it took about 2 weeks for my tv to be collected. I ordered a newer model off the tv as i thought it would be better quality (£900 tv may i add) this broke within 5 weeks too! Half the screen went dark. I have rang samsung and they were meant to collect day but rang yesterday and it has not been booked in again!!! I work full time and live on my own, this has made my life hell over the last couple of months. Avoid this company at all costs

Staff in store gave me 5 excuses as to why they couldn't help with my faulty product, none of which made any sense, treating me like I'm an fool. All this AFTER I had been referred to the store by the online team. <br/><br/>Called customer services, again got the run around for 20 minutes. The team on the phone doing all they could to push my manufacturer warranty claim to the retailer (or anyone they could think of). Refused my legal right to pursue a claim under warranty for a manufacturer defect in a 3 month old product, telling me I should claim from the company that sold me it. Clearly no training in what the law says or in customer service.

                My name is Lam. I'm Samsung loyal customer for more than 10 years. Recently,I bought the Samsung Note 10+ on Cyber Monday with the deal $500 store credit, so I decided to use the credit to get the tablet s6 on Dec 2, 2019 and the order # S1C4VC60SR.<br/>I kept the tablet for 2 months still sealed never open it. So today Feb 5, 2020; I was so exciting to open the tablet to use it for the first time. When I turn the tablet on the the screen is not working, I thought that the battery is low, so I use the original charger that came with device to charge, but the device wont turn on. I contacted the customer service on Samsung.com and the representative told me to bring the tablet to Samsung store and they will give me the replacement no question ask.<br/>I drove about 2 hours to the store, when I got there, I showed them the text between me and customers service, but they won't accept to give replacement for me, <br/>as what the representative on Samsung.com have said.The Samsung store's employee called the customers service on Samsung.com, after that they told me they can't give me the replacement, only option they can offer me that to claim the warranty and fix my tablet. I asked them my tablet is brand new, I want to get a replacement for another brands new device, and I do not feel comfortable with the repair like that. They told me that, it is the only way to do.<br/>My question is that way you do it will make the customers happy with your company? Second questions is how different when you buy the product from the Samsung store and Samsung.com, when the customers need help your help, and you say that you cannot do anything when your buy online Samsung.com. What is wrong? It is does not matter Samsung store or Samsung.com are still belong Samsung company. I feel like you are cheating on your customers like me in this case that do not allow have any choice or personal opinion. Your product not cheap, the cost is almost like Apple's products.<br/>Do you know why Apple have more customers than Samsung? Because they are think for their customers, and they are do not cheating on customers like your company. They have the best service in the market. Samsung just want your money, and you do not care for the customers at all.<br/>I hope the Samsung owner can read everything I write and my opinion of the way your business and your employees how they are cheating on customers.<br/>I hope all customers can read this message, and speak up for themselves to get Samsung's become more friendly to the loyal customers. <br/>Samsung do not let your customers thinking your company is chasing the revenue and only cheating them.<br/>Hopefully I get the response from the Samsung owner to explain to me about this matter.<br/><br/>Best regard.

                Welcome to my Samsung USA HORROR story. Sorry , this will be longish and every word is the truth.<br/>I live in Toronto, Canada. On a vacation trip Dec/19 to Scottsdale AZ I left my Samsung tablet on the West Jet plane by mistake. Never to be seen again. On Dec 26/19 I went to Best Buy in Scottsdale and bought a new Samsung S3 tablet and the matching Samsung case with keyboard. All until Nov/19 when I decided to expand my memory storage with a micro SD card. Bought two, one for my Samsung S9+ cell and the tablet. New card worked perfect on cell but didn’t work on the tablet.  I went to a Samsung Experience store in Toronto. The tech there diagnosed the problem to be a faulty motherboard, which he said was probably from day 1. The tablet is still under warranty (I have all of the original paperwork, store invoice etc.) BUT the Samsung rep proceeds to tell me that Samsung Canada and Samsung US are two different operations and they would/could not repair my tablet as I had to send it to the US for repair. I was also told by a Best Buy store in Toronto that their US and Canadian operation are independent for warranty purposes.  I contacted Samsung US (Nov/19) who confirms the NON International warranty situation and proceeds to tell me the following. Samsung US will email me a UPS shipping label for the return BUT the unit mailed be shipped from within the US AND Samsung will not return my unit to Canada.  Also, the UPS shipping label is only good for 7 days.  GREAT !!!   OK, I believe a have a game plan.  We were going into Buffalo NY for New Years then going to Florida from Jan 7 – 31 / 20.  He advised to call back around Dec 29/19 to get a UPS shipping label.  Following his suggestion, I called back Dec 26/19 to get the UPS label, the Samsung person asked me why I was waiting to send the tablet as the UPS shipping label CAN be used from Canada.  This is where the nightmare begins. Following his (Samsung’s) instructions I package up my tablet with the accessories as the instructions say to do.  Also, as per the written instructions I unlock to tablet so it can be repaired.  Shipped it off to Samsung repair in New Jersey, with my Florida return address. I rushed to UPS to ship my tablet and that was the last time I would see it…….   By the way, I am a CPA who now has an unlocked Samsung tablet floating around.   Apparently, the last Samsung rep was totally wrong, the UPS shipping label CAN NOT be shipped from Canada. Zoom ahead a few months and probably 20 – 25 hours on the phone with calls to UPS and Samsung, I have emails from UPS saying how Samsung US was not co-operating with them, holding everything up. UPS finally throws in towel and declares my shipment lost and sends me a lost package claim form. I send it off with all pertinent info needed.  UPS gets back to saying they can only pay this loss claim to the shipper who they declare is Samsung US and not me. I now reach out to Samsung Case Mgmt. rep (probably the 5th person in this top echelon)  (Manager -   Albert  - ID  0864  - Case Mgmt. ticket # 4151977296) seeking payment. This is Samsung’s US ultimate resolution.  They will pay me for the lost/defective tablet but not for the lost case/keyboard as it is their policy not to pay for accessories. I told them that I have a HUGE problem with that as UPS is willing and prepared to pay Samsung for the entire lost shipment. I could not get the Samsung manager to understand the concept that ultimately they were not paying me but UPS is, if Samsung makes the appropriate loss claim to UPS, I could not get through to him.   <br/>WAIT, we are not done yet. <br/><br/> Apparently, the Samsung US computer software is NOT capable of entering a Canadian address in their system to mail me my cheque directly so I have to have it send to a friend in Florida who in turn with will mail it to me.<br/>What an unbelievable nightmare and horror story. I don’t think I could have created a bizarre, crazy story like this if I had tried !! Not one person I have spoken

                Samsung promotion offering 50% cashback on high-end soundbar if purchased within 30 days of high-end TV. I Spent around £3800 on purchase expecting about £750 back for the soundbar. When they eventually replied to my emails, I was told that I had only applied for the promotion on the TV, not the soundbar even though I followed their instructions extremely carefully!!! I scanned both my TV receipt and soundbar receipt and sent in one e-mail as that's what the brochure said - apparently, I was supposed to send in two separate applications even though it was very clear that I wanted the money back for the soundbar - instead, they sent me 10 Rakuten movie rental vouchers for the TV purchase. Absolute SCAM - I'll never buy Samsung again.

                Worst shopping experience I’ve ever had. Bought a Q80r TV. Confirmed faulty within 30 days. Advised I could repair or replace but best to replace as it was within 30 days. Communication was terrible. They were supposed to send a returns box but didn’t. Informed they had to return to site and then I would have to wait 10 working days for replacement as they can’t do both in the same day!  I would suggest they just don’t trust their customers.....even though I’d sent images and the fault had been confirmed.<br/><br/>Day after the return I get an email with a confirmation of a refund, no explanation. After calling again for the 5th time, informed they had no stock so had refunded me without letting me know. If I’d had the option I would have just taken the repair. No alternative offered.  Shocking customer service. I won’t buy Samsung again.

                You buy a smartphone from a trusted brand safe in the knowledge there is a 24 month guarantee and you assume excellent customer service. <br/><br/>Just shows how wrong you can be. <br/><br/>Display on Note 8 started flashing but only in 50% of the screen, the rest of the screen was black. No worries contact customer service and get a free warranty repair. <br/><br/>I sent the phone of to a service centre in Poland (from Germany) and wait. A few days later I get asked for EUR 180 to repair it. They apparently found a microscopic blemish on the side of the screen somewhere. They sent a photo with a 40x magnification picture of it. When you go to such lengths to blame customers and avoid your guarantee this makes me very suspicious. It seems odd that the screen was exactly occulting at 50%, was I so precise in creating my microscopic damage?<br/><br/>So trust lost from a previously loyal customer.

                Samsung stick rigidly to the 28 days return &amp; replace policy even if the merchandise was faulty the day it left the factory.  The brand is letting itself down. Brand new Note 10 plus 5G just had PBA Module replaced after fault detected 34 days after receipt of goods. Painful parts are a) it was almost impossible to detect the problem in the timeframe; b) Samsung service centre staff Plymouth were not particularly helpful and seemed unskilled in diagnosing fault/explaining issues. Outcome stuck with a phone I've lost confidence in. Also brand loyalty gone too.

                Samsung is probably the worst company that I have had the misfortune to deal with regarding Reliability and Warranty support. <br/>My story:<br/>I bought my first Samsung Combi Microwave in April 2017 which broke down and was sent back to Amazon.es under their own 2 year warranty and they refunded me.  Then I bought my 2nd Combi microwave on March 7 2018 from Amazon.es but this time through a third party seller.  Again I have had nothing but problems with it since then.  In early April 2019, the button board electronics failed and It was taken away and repaired by an engineer from Algeciras, Spain.   The buttons failed for the second time in November 2019. It was repaired again and the engineer said that if I had any more problems, they would replace the microwave <br/><br/>The same day I received the microwave back after the second repair it started sparking and I sent a video to the engineer. He agreed that Samsung should now replace the microwave.  <br/><br/>However, various discussions with Samsung produced no positive result and then over and after the Christmas period of 2019 all communication ceased. <br/>When I eventually spoke to Samsung's warranty department in January 2020, they had the nerve to say that the sparking was not covered by the warranty and was my problem.   It began to spark the same day that the engineer returned it to me, but they did not take this fact into account. I would suggest that some engineer caused the problem during the repair. How could it have been me?  I only started it with just a cup of milk inside, so that suggestion was ridiculous. I bought the microwave through Amazon.es, but because it was sold by a third party seller 'Electroshop Online' they couldn't offer much help.  The seller didn't want to know and just said Contact Samsung and after several more attempts to solve the problem I gave up.  My advice ….do not buy a Samsung microwave !

                Samsung does not provide customer service, only heaps of frustration. We've been trying to get Samsung to repair our 65"" television for 2 years now. After buying better HDMI cables, numerous calls and chat sessions, as well as filing a BBB report they finally sent out Dish technicians to repair the television with new parts. Two weeks ago, the techs spent over 3 hours replacing the main board, cables and a couple other parts. They could not get the TV to work properly, so they took it apart again to put all the old parts back. They had me sign a contract that I couldn't make out, due to the signature area covering the contract on the iPad. The tech said he would email me a copy of what they did on the contract. I did receive the contract, but other than my signature, it's completely blank? Yes, I unwittingly signed a blank contract? Samsung even told the BBB that the case is resolved, because their techs were fixing it? They did not. I hadn't heard anything from Samsung, so I emailed Montez Gaffney @ Samsung Office of President who had the service techs sent to our home. He refuses to respond to me or the BBB now, so I'm forced to write reviews and get consumer affairs involved. Our 2 Panasonic plasma televisions haven't given us a lick of trouble in 7-8 years, but all we've had with this Samsung is 2 years of headaches.

                I bought a Samsung A50 in Peru Lima Airport from a phone shop in December 2019. I was assured of a worldwide guarantee and it's fine in UK. Got home phone never worked, visited Glasgow shop twice, took 2 half days off work to go up and personal cost. I am self employed. Shop says can't do anything put it down to a bad experience, contacted customer services they said they would collect the phone, it went to Glasgow. An attempt was made to change motherboard etc but no solution was found. The phone was returned screen all scratched. I called Glasgow shop they said we never touched your phone, yet 2 days earlier a colleague informed me it was stripped down. I have called and been hung up on after long holds. I have been treated with disrespect, bad experience, asked do you want the phone back etc. I requested a contact to help me, they don't know anything, I requested email or phone number for CEO Mr Chun, they never knew who he was, best of all no contact information. This for a global company is a joke, shop service experience, waited in a que 45 minutes to get seen to, told to come back in 45 minutes, waited another 30 minutes to get nothing, no decision no responsibility. Calls made, put on hold for hours, hung up on during holds, never got call backs ignored. No structure to get information or assistance to help you get a resolve. I am almost £300 out of pocket, SAMSUNG is £300 up and I get not only a broken device but one badly scratched screen to. I have tried every angle and will continue to spread the word of total incompetence untill I get answers. If Samsung are happy with this treatment then I can't recommend them, we have Tv's, watches, phones etc but will I buy another product. Not sure if I could stomach all this disgraceful treatment again. I gave Samsung a 1 star in this review only because if I never there was no review. I would after my experience not rate Samsung at all. Take your money and leave you high and dry.

                Most pathetic business and store around. Raised a complaint over 2 weeks ago, and Samsung Customer Service and the Kings Cross store have done nothing about it. Kings Cross store is uncontactable, which is ironic given they are one of the largest telecommunications company in the industry. Check out all these reviews. Avoid at all costs. Go elsewhere

                Purchased Gear s3 Classic watch and with the last download the watch disconnected from my phone and repeatedly says it is rebooting.  I have tried every possible solution suggested on the internet.  I have contacted customer service through a chat and on the phone and was told I would have to go to a service center to see if it a problem with the watch. There are lists of complaints for this issue on the internet, obviously it is NOT the mechanics of the watch!  NO help from customer service at all!

                I purchased a Samsung front load washer.  After less than three years and slight use (once per month), the washer failed to complete the last spin cycle.<br/><br/>Samsung offered to pay for the parts (""one time basis""), even though the unit was out of warranty.  I paid for the labor at $125.  Seemed pretty fair, though I was surprised that the washer failed after such a short time.

                Shocking service, last time I purchase a samsung product, had several problems with a very expensive 75 inch tv, after a new screen fitted the problem persisted , samsung then sent out a samsung engineer out and identified a problem, they then sent ANOTHER appointment engineer out who also identified a problem, samsung management team got back to me , saying this is normal due to expansion and contraction. If my tv is still expanding after being on for 8/10 hours plus its a SERIOUS HAZARD! Im concerned and samsung said its normal. Engineers must have gotten it wrong

                Absolutely dreadful brand. Samsung knowingly make money from the parts they sell you to correct their design faults.  If you have worked hard for your money stay away from this brand.  There are plenty of brands out there at much less cost, which will get you to the warranty period.<br/><br/>Samsung customer service is as atrocious as their products the pigeon English replies assures you Samsung have no understanding of the market or how bad their equipment is.

                I bought a brand new smart fridge and washing machine costing me £4500 approx, 2 years later the fridge breaks, then the washing machine breaks down. These devices cost me an arm and a leg and all Samsung do is fob it off. I was told I would get goodwill gesture which did not materialise, the washing breaks down every month. Both fridge and washing machine are smart products. DO NOT Buy SAMSUNG PRODUCTS they are of a rubbish quality and you will be wasting your money! They said d they would escalate but nothing came out of it. Now I want a full refund and these products off my premises.

                Placed order and paid in full for a Galaxy note 10 Plus.  Paid for next day timed delivery.  Phone did not arrive and DPD online said it was not delivered to their depot in time.  I called Samsung and after a long conversation they said they would call me back to advise.  I ended up having DPD local depot call me to advise the package was lost.  Called Samsung and asked for a refund.  They advised me they could not do this as the goods had been shipped.  I then was advised to get a refund they required an investigation by DPD which would take between 3-5 days then they would carry out an internal review which they could not advise how long this would take but suggested another 4 days.  Currently I am £940 pounds out of pocket through no fault of mine and have little chance of are fund in the next 2 weeks.   Samsung even acknowledge they have been advised by DPD the package is lost.  My advice dont buy from Samsung direct

                First issue<br/>Samsung screwed me out of a Brand-New pair of ICON X. I had the device less then a week when I had to send it off for repairs. After confirming with multiple reps that they received my icon X, it went missing then all of a sudden, they needed a tracking number.<br/>Second Issue<br/> I have a useless Note10+ (unlocked version) that I cannot use because it is no compatible with the AT&amp;T network. They did such a wonderful job selling me a device that they promised would work the only difference was it unlocked meaning I could take it to any carrier. I called Samsung and explained to them that this phone is not compatible with AT&amp;T, so they gave me a ticket # to return the device. I asked them to please have the service department call me so I can explain to them the issues I’m experiencing and to please not send me back the same unlocked device. Not only did they not call me, they sent me back the same device. Fast forward to today, Samsung told me there is nothing they can do for me after they sold me a device that they promised would work with my carrier. Now I’m stuck with a device I can’t use.

                Dec. 3, 2019 I purchased a Samsung 65"" television from Visions in Winnipeg.  I was told it was out of stock but would be available in 3 days, if not by Friday then on Monday, that would have been Dec. 9.  I was told the units had shipped but they were unable to get any tracking info from their rep who works for the distributor of Samsung in Canada.  I have made a number of calls both to the salesman we purchased from and to his manager.  Just last week although these units are supposedly still in transit they offered me another model of Samsung for an extra $100.  I don't feel I should have to pay any additional $'s, they then offered me a Hisense or a Panasonic.  Darn it I want the Samsung I purchased!  Today I contacted Samsung Canada thinking they could possibly give Visions a push, they told me to work it out with the selling dealer.  This tells me an awful lot about Samsung's attitude toward their consumers.....THEY JUST DON""T CARE!

                Samsung WD6000 Washer Dryer, I have had my machine for around 11 months, I do a lot of laundry in my house, I dont like to have laundry hanging around so generally do 2 loads a day, most of my loads are around 40-50% of the drum capacity. This machine only likes full loads to wash, anything under 70% full and it wont spin it, so the washing comes out dripping, you have to run a separate spin cycle at least 1s or wash again in a bigger load. Unless you are drying a pair of socks you have to put the machine on the drying cycle at least twice to get a half load dry. Compared to my last 2 washer dryers by other brands it takes at least double the amount of time to get a load washed and dried in this machine. I generally buy a new machine every 3-4 years, I give up with this machine and i'm off to buy a new 1. I'm a working mum and dont have time to sit by the machines side!!

On the 25.12.19 they had 2 offers on with a phone. I have never come across Customer service like Samsung. It's like talking to children infact worse at least children listen. The company should be called SAM SANK. They don't care about you all they want is your money once they have that god help you. They are incapable of dealing with anything let alone a query. I would love the CEO to email me with regarding to my complaint. I am angry with myself for actually think that this company cares about its customers clearly it doesn't. I'm moving to APPLE at least the after care is excellent.<br/>I should have listened to my son who works on the customer service desk of a very well know electrical shop. He said that the worse item to purchase is a ""SAMSUNG"" item as the customer service is non EXISTENT! He said to me don't even bother ringing them you will be wasting your time. Boy was he right.

                Do not buy the note 10 plus. It has a temprature sensor that doesn't work and your phone will never charge, and Samsung can't even admit this issue like they did with the Note 7. I deeply regret this 1000 euro and I will never spend a penny on a Samsung product again. When I spend 1000 euros on a phone I should at least expect it to charge. The folks down at Samsung service can't understand to remove the temprature limits so I guess I am stuck with a 1000 euro useless landline phone, ty Samsung.

                I wanted to connect my (apartment's) TV to the web. After a software update it worked, however slow. To communicate with the TV I would need a mouse and keyboard. As it didn't seem to support bluetooth I called Samsung support who confirmed it wouldn't. They had no idea what type of mouse/keyboard I could use. The accessories team did not know either. In an email they recommended then a bluetooth keyboard (no mouse). Explaining that their own customer service confirmed it doesn't have bluetooth didn't impress them. My next electronic device (phone, TV etc.) will not be Samsung. There is no technical support and you might end up buying unsuitable equipment.

                Samsung DO NOT have a customer service department. Instead you are transferred to a call center in New Delhi where the staff are robotic and have zero empathy to your complaints.<br/>After buying a brand new Samsung TV this year we found that it couldn't connect with our game consoles. The hdmi port also sparked when we tried to change the leads. After about 5 called to the 'support' line we were told that it wasn't the TVs fault and to call the company of the consoles.<br/>I decided to speak to a manager, was put on hold then was cut off. I had to call another department in order for them to transfer me. The manager was worse than the technical 'support' team. He was almost silent and was very clipped with his replies. After 10 minutes he finally decided to send out an engineer. After 2 days I got a  text to say a person would be coming.... 1 week later!!!! Annoyed I phoned a number for somewhere in England. The woman was worse than the technical team. Very aloof. Uncaring, She even stated in an aggressive tone, 'other people are on the same boat as you'. I replied, ""If You know this why is Samsung ignoring their customer care?"" <br/>She was silent and dismisive.<br/>So now I have an engineer arriving on a day that I am at work. If he decides not to slot us in on a time when I am home we will have to wait another week with this awful TV. <br/>After years of trusting Samsung, I will not but parting with my money on their products again.

                I purchased a phone, and the next day I tried to cancel the order. Not only was the option not available to me, it was also not available to any customer service agents either. Samsung as the seller had placed restrictions on my delivery as well, and made it so I could not refuse the package I had paid my money for. I then had to bounce back and forth between Samsung and the shipping company on cancelling it. After 5 separate calls and about 2 and a half hours of call time I was able to refuse the package. Just kidding, it still arrived at my house, and now I have to wait for it to go all the way back to Samsung, who was aware of me not wanting the package before it was even shipped.

                I have many Samsung products which have been faultless. This review is about Samsung delivery and customer services. <br/><br/>I ordered a washing machine from Samsung on 20/12/19 as my current washing machine had broken down and I am having a full house over Christmas. The reason I ordered from Samsung was because they offered next day delivery for £30. <br/><br/>I received an email giving me a 2 hour window for delivery. During the delivery window I received a text from the delivery company informing me they hadn’t received the washing machine from Samsung. <br/><br/>I phoned Samsung and was told they will inform their logistics department and they will get in touch with me. <br/><br/>It is now Christmas Eve, my guests are about to turn up and I have no way for people to wash their clothes. I phoned Samsung again and was told the logistics team will be in touch and I just need to keep waiting. <br/><br/>Samsung’s customer service is a shambles.

                Very disappointed with the Samsung TV we purchased for our parents on 12/12/17 as a Christmas gift.  (Samsung 40MU6120 ) In July 2018 a mere 7 months later the tv experienced serious screen distortion. A number of white lines appeared in the centre of the screen. We contacted Samsung who put us in touch with a company who would rectify the fault. I was somewhat surprised that instead of replacing the tv they merely replaced the screen. In November of  this year the same fault occurred with a number of white vertical lines appearing on the screen. Enquiries at Curry’s where tv was purchased could not assist as the tv was out of guarantee. The sales assistant informed us that it would be a pressure fault, we were unlucky but it is quite common in Samsung. To say I was disappointed to have a tv last under 2 years including in that time a replacement screen is an understatement but the response from Samsung was even more disappointing. The company who replaced the screen after 7 months quoted £350 for a new screen but offered to approach Samsung to see if they would give us a goodwill gesture and allow replacement of screen for cost. (Ie about £150). This was refused so my parents are now having replace their TV. They will not be purchasing Samsung but will return to Sony. This experience from such a large company has caused great disappointment and will certainly discourage me from purchasing Samsung again. I would expect a TV to last longer than 2 years.

After samsung received the phone back I didn't get any conformation or email whatsoever. Been keeping ringing and all the time was told same story I have to wait 3-5working days. today is 23th of December and the case is still not resolved. Not received any email from samsung. I will contact ombudsman asap because this is joke and anacceptable! Very very disappointed I spend over 1k and still not get refund

                Just had superb support from Min via Live Chat re the problem relating to bbc I player with certain TVs.  Unfortunately the chat timed out, so I was unable to thank Min personally.<br/><br/>However, I then spoke to a very patient lady in the call centre who was on hand while I tried to log in to my bbc account ~ the final stage of of solving the problem.  Evidently, even though the Live Chat had timed out, Min had still been working on the problem via remote access to the TV<br/><br/>Only criticism...please stop the live chats from timing out without warning

                Absolutely worst customer service EVER do to the inexperienced droids they have!! Seriously how many times can you ask to have one problem solved and someone gives you a fake line of crap!! I have called in multiple times to get this ridiculous constant updating turned off. Every “Customer service person” at first seems to know what they are doing and every single time they fail. This tv if it wasn’t for the 40 minute updates ever week would be tolerable. They all say this will fix it call back in if it does not. Non of their “FAKE” fixes work. I want a new tv that actually play when you need it too! DO NOT BUY FROM SAMSUNG!!!!!

                I have just bought two QLED Samsung TV Bundles (Q70R 49inch, Q60R 43inch and two soundbars) through Samsung Online (I previously had a 47inch Toshiba). The products are fantastic and they are well worth the price. The Samsung AI upscaling is incredible and definitely outperforms other TV brands. I recently watched BBC David Attenborough’s Seven Worlds, One Continent in stunning 4K HDR and I have never seen anything like it. The TVs are well made and are easy to set up. The Smart facility of the TV has a fantastic range of streaming apps and is very responsive and easy to navigate. The soundbars are also incredible but the TV alone has great speakers. I would highly recommend both TVs. Delivery was also prompt (delivered by Panther Group). I will be buying from you again in the near future.<br/><br/>I also used the Samsung Live Chat service to ask for assistance and Ellie G was extremely helpful and very pleasant.

                Terrible Customer Service<br/><br/>I've never in my life felt more compelled to write a review regarding customer service, of which Samsung have none - they should be ashamed.<br/><br/>Should you call the ""0330 SAM SHOP"", you will be presented an enthusiastic operator who promises you they will sort your issue, only for them not to call or email you back with an update, or for the wrong information to be passed over further wasting your time and no remorse for in the inconvenience.<br/><br/>I ordered a TV in November, the item was not delivered so asked for a redelivery on a specified date. The date I requested was not passed on to the logistics company but booked for whatever slot was going which meant no one was home to receive it and the delivery was missed again. <br/>Called customer service multiple times after that where (I thought) we had arranged a new time for delivery, only for the slot not to be booked with the logistics company at all.<br/><br/>You can imagine the frustration this has caused and hassle where schedules had to be reworked and amounted to nothing. The TV was bought in the Black Friday Sales and has enviably gone back up to a price point I'm not willing to pay for. So not only have I endured this, I won't be able to purchase the TV I wanted!<br/><br/>My last encounter, a request (again) for a new delivery date, resulted in the operator promising to call me back when they reached the bottom of my issue, only to receive an email saying my order was complete, an invoice and my supposed request for refund.<br/><br/>The cheek of the matter is beyond words. <br/><br/>If you must by a Samsung product, buy it from a 3rd Party. They are not worth your time.

                I wish I could choose to give 0 stars.  Product quality is horrible.  I have owned the unit for 7 months.  I has broken 5 times resulting in puddles of water around the entire refrigerator and food spoilage on all occasions.  Their service center will not notify you of a time window until the day of the scheduled repair, but then they do not arrive in that window.  They call after the window of time has passed to say they will be another 2 hours late.  When you call their customer service center, they will not allow you to submit a complaint.  The warranty is from the date they manufactured the unit, not the date of purchase which effectively shortened my warranty by 5 months.  The goal of their horrible service and repeated delays seems to be making sure my warranty expires so they will not have to replace the unit.  Hour long phone calls to try to resolve the problem are ""not counted"" toward the number of problems that will lead to a replacement.  Do not buy a Samsung product.  Horrible quality and even worse service.  There is absolutely no concern for the customer.

                Bought a Samsung smart TV in Jan 2017.  Now Dec 2019 a vertical black line has appeared.  Contacted Samsung and gave them all the info they asked for including the registered guarantee ref no they gave me when I registered the tv.  The guarantee was an offer that if you register the product within 90 days of purchase, you will be eligible for a 5 year warranty.  They now say this does not exist and they don't know anything about this even though they are still advertising this on their website albeit not for TVs anymore.  TV is not fit for purpose with a fault like this.  After investigation, seems like this is a common fault.  Wish I knew this before I bought it.  Will now go down the Consumer Rights route to have it fixed.  Samsung are no help at all.  AVOID SAMSUNG TVs.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  If we all boycote Samsung, hopefully they will suffer from a drop in sales.

                Some 6 months ago i purchased a fridge-freezer (Model RB33N321NSS) from a generally well-reputed retailer, who requested Samsung to deliver it direct to me. 7 weeks ago the fan stopped blowing cold air from freezer to fridge. After long waiting periods on helpdesk phone to store, (one I had to give up on) and then visit the store, an assistant advised us to contact Samsung, as their responsibility ended after 30 days, so having had nightmare experiences over two days on their own 'helpdesk', waiting for long periods and not knowing whether anyone would pick up, the assistant made the call for me and i got asked a long list of questions to check whether i was the cause and not their product. (Frustration is not helped by having no free landline number to call and having to hold mobile to ear for long periods, plus signal problems and the frequent difficulty in understanding the agents' questions and instructions.)  Long story cut very short, i finally got an engineer's visit. He found a lump of solid ice around the fan and said he would get whole item replaced within a few days. Late following day they phoned to say Samsung were wanting another test done before they would agree to replace. Engineer added more refrigerant as requested as a temporary fix and I was informed again that a replacement fridge-freezer was now ordered and would be coming via a courier. Samsung meanwhile wanted to see the original sales Invoice as proof of purchase, but store do not deal with paper now, using just one code number that accesses all detail. Fortunately, by this time i had been put in touch with two helpful advisors at the store, who would help me liaise with the other 3 companies involved, and the local man found the till receipt on the system to email on to Samsung. Since then a head office case manager has been brilliant in liaising with Samsung and other companies, and getting the replacement to me, (after 2 failed delivery attempts) which hopefully will not develop the problem again. My advice would be to always check the retailer will supply 'Amazon-type' customer support in getting manufacturers to take notice of customers' complaints- beyond a few days after purchase. After all, we have bought the item from the store where it is displayed, not the manufacturer- with a certain amount of trust involved.  Also check that they provide adequate paperwork at time of sale, including clear printed warranty conditions. As can be seen from others' reports here too- it would not do to have flimsy, or no, store backup, dealing with replacements from Samsung. Unfortunately, without such backup support, I very much doubt I would have the replacement now. In fact AFTER 7 WEEKS WAITING, 2 letters to head offices, many phone calls, early poor helpline response, (after which store case manager took over), general lack of concern and competence, I would have been reduced to even more of a gibbering wreck by now, as health was deteriorating fast.

                I ordered two curved monitors (via Amazon) and the stand for one of them was not at the same angle as the other so the monitors were not aligned.  I contacted Samsung via their Live Chat Support and they agreed to replace the stand, which I received two days later. Very pleased with the service.

                If there’s a zero. I will give it. During thanks giving, I order 4 appliance. On the website, they offer 10% bundle discount in addition to the promotion price. But, when I place the order, the bundle discount disappeared. I didn’t notice until a week later. And their customer phone takes forever to connect. When I talked to their representative finally, they asked me to cancel thanksgiving order and place another one. But, no more promotion and my house project is delayed. They are not responsible for their website bug.

                Unfortunately SAMSUNG has the WORST customer service ever. I’ve been waiting for my refund for an item I returned since August 2019 now we are in December 2019 and haven’t gotten it every time I call them they tell me next week you’ll be receiving it since August they’ve been telling me that. I’m very disappointed I really hate Samsung now worst customer service they can’t deal with customers problems. I will never buy anything from Samsung.

                The Samsung Canada Customer Care and delivery team are the worst in the industry. Period. I bought an expensive 4K QLED television from Samsung Canada. The delivery driver reported the product as delivered when in fact it had not been delivered. In contrast, when I purchase a product online through Amazon, the delivery driver will leave a note on my door if I am not there to tell me where I can pick up the product. Most of the Customer Care staff were either rude or incompetent or both. Also, most of the staff do not speak English very well so I was surprised they would be given a job to speak on the phone with customers who are paying a lot of money to purchase the Samsung products. Do yourself a favor, save the hassle and aggravation, and shop elsewhere.

                Avoid purchasing Samsung products,<br/>I purchased a tablet A brand new and had to send it back over a month due to a bulge appearing on the side of the tablet progressively getting worse. Making casing come away. I send this straight back as it was brand new and they have come back to me and said this was done due to Incorrect use of sim tray when removing even though it hasn't been touched as it's purely used with WiFi. so in a nutshell they shifted the blame they then went on to say <br/><br/>First Observations<br/>Device is in fair condition, powers up, not rooted, no accessories present for inspection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Engineer Findings<br/><br/>LCD not cracked;<br/>Rear cover not cracked, slightly deformed due to incorrect sim tray removal process;<br/>No signs of dust/debris on tape.<br/>No signs of liquid or physical damage to PBA.<br/>No sign of liquid contamination/ingress on the sub-pba usb charging port of device<br/>LDI Not activated.<br/>No excessive overheating observed.<br/>Wired charging pulls correct current, however, the battery shows different percentage when is put to charging process due to a potential faulty battery.<br/><br/>The conclusion was they would fix the whole lot for me due to the faulty battery. But leaving a sour taste in my mouth as they tried to shift the blame to me. When I haven't touched the sim tray and the tablet has been boxed and well looked after . On to my next point the fact they say fair condition what does this mean there is not a single scratch on it what are they rating as fair ? This makes me worried that they class it as fair condition that I've got a below standard product? Im also now worried I've got a product with a fault that is now being refurbished and Sent back to me after 1 month . Awful in my eyes ?

                This is what you get when you contact Samsung support<br/>Hi all,<br/>We have bought a Samsung Galaxy S10e - and after few months you can hear a rattle coming from the inside of the device (close to top speaker on the device) so we have contacted Samsung for warranty repair.<br/>The pick up service Samsung offers is waste of time, have agreed a date for the phone to be picked up - but day before the pickup date at 5PM - I have received an email stating that my repair is booked for 2 weeks later - went to Samsung and asked why my date was moved - they said that they received an email before 5PM and no one actually bothered to let me know!!!<br/>And i only took a day off for this - no big deal!<br/>Phone was sent off (eventually) for repair and just came back - with the same rattle as it had before - went on Samsung website to get this sorted and was speaking with a advised that actually given me the number to people where the phone was repaired and I was told to get this sorted myself and he disconnected me - rude! (Cs rep name was Alphyne)<br/>Since Samsung has given me the middle finger I have phoned  people at Samsung repair and I was told that this rattle comes from a camera and its quite normal for those to be like that??? WHAT?? - even that I have said to them that we have had a look at another S10e and no rattle could be heard - and when we have bought the device no on made us aware that we are baying a most expensive ""rattle toy"" you could ever imagine and have been advised they wont look at this again.<br/>In the meantime I have received an apologetic letter from someone at Samsung but when I phoned back to get to the bottom of this - no one knew what I was talking about. Never again<br/><br/>Several users reporting this issue on various websites so I'm not the only one.

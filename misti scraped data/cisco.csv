                Been on hold now for 40 min waiting to speak to customer service... this is after waiting about the same to speak to some completely rude, non-english speaking ""tech support"" person who was completely, utterly unhelpful.

                FAO Cisco and Potential Future Candidates: <br/><br/>I have been studying towards my ICND1 since July and have invested a lot of time in to learning and mastering the Cisco study material. Firstly, I have had multiple issues where the site has been down or labs are unavailable which has resulted in me pushing back my exam 3 times due to the loss of study time. I raised this with Cisco and had to settle for a gesture of good will refund which was around 12% - appreciated however money doesn't buy the time back. <br/><br/>Please also note, this is also time sensitive as I will need to complete my CCNA exam before February as it will be discontinued due to the changes. <br/><br/>Today I sat my ICND1 exam, during my exam - the lab failed and froze on a 4-part question. I raised this with the lady at the test center who came to take a look and didn't pause my time until 5 minutes after verifying that there indeed was an issue (so 5 minutes exam time lost) - then once she phoned Cisco, they advised her I would have to skip the 4-part question and carry on. So I did. My score was 816 and my pass mark was 832, I in myself know I passed as I knew the answer to the question which I was unable to answer due to Cisco's error. Even if I was able to answer 1 part out of the 4-part question, I would have passed. <br/><br/>As soon as I left the test center, I contacted Cisco - after speaking with a customer service representative, then the supervisor (Daniel) and then the manager (Ali) - I was advised that this needs to be looked at by the technical team and I should expect a phone call in 3-5 working days. I was also advised that I cannot resit the exam for 7 days due to company policy, even though this was their mistake. On top of this, the manager advised me that at most they would be able to offer me is a refund once this has been looked in to by the technical team. I find this completely outrageous that I have failed an exam due to their mistake and all they can offer me is a refund. <br/><br/>This does not compensate for the time I have taken off work, the stress I have experienced with this exam and potential further time off work. I should be able to resit the 4-part question (or one similar) and not have to re-do the whole test again. <br/><br/>My certificate with my score says ""As a Cisco certification candidate, you deserve a fair and secure testing experience"" - This was most definitely not a fair experience. Even if/when Cisco offer a re-sit of my exam, this is still not justifiable. I should have passed today and this was all down to Cisco. After my CCNA, I will never sit a Cisco certification again and I definitely would not recommend Cisco to anyone.

                I purchased, and continued to buy up to date, Cisco products, certain of their business strength and therefore trusting in excellent customer service. Never what was wrong!<br/>Despite months of calls and emails trying to get me to attend for their semi-professional router guaranteed for life, the WRSV4400N, Cisco has deliberately decided not to provide any assistance for their product, a lifetime guaranteed memory and no longer working, although it is It has always been used under the Smart Ups APC UPS. And to say that I have always bought and bought Cisco to friends, law firms and other professionals, in the belief, now clearly wrong, to treat a brand of excellence as can be that of Apple, a company that, unlike Cisco, until today He never disappointed me. When the WRSV4400N started to reboot continuously becoming unusable, I immediately ordered a Cisco RV340 and, a few days later, an RV130W, this happened on 2 November 2018. My trust was placed in Cisco even if sometimes its products do not they are really up to date, the RV130W does not have the Fi AC protocol.<br/>I think the company policy on products with a lifetime warranty must be known to everyone so that others are not fooled by Cisco.<br/>Even their commercial practice in Italy is considered incorrect by virtue of deceptive advertising on a product guaranteed for life.<br/>Deeply disappointed by Cisco

                Cisco is a very big company so that there are many suppliers of its products. I don't know which is the better. However, to order a product from Cisco will cost me much money. It is a trouble.

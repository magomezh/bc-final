                Their services is inexistent !!!!!  I bought two ink cartridges and never received them.  They had shipped 18 days earlier (I was supposed to receive in 1 or 2 days) and the teaching shipping record was not moving.   It keeps calling them and indicated that the package has not left their store and was not reporting any progress.  I wrote to them 5 times and they keep saying that it will arrive at a certain point.  They never replaced them.  By reading the overall rating (1 star, 1200+ report) I am not alone.

                Highway robbery. What in the world. I paid for instant ink. Ink cartridge is faulty. This is not the first time so it is no coincidence believe me. I can't get a real person for support and they want to charge 19.99 to speak with someone. I am sadly disappointed in HP. I thought they were a reliable company but all I see is a lack of care, greed, and the runaround.  Now they have my $15 paid on May 2nd, the cartridge is no good,  I can't get a tech support, and a virtual agent is not helping but shoots out responses that were made with people may encounter. Don't blame it on COVID - COVID didn't stop you from taking money yet you can't supply service. What about your customers. Wake up HP, dishonest gain never lasts.

                In March, I ordered an HP Envy Desktop with several custom features, cost around $1,500.  Initially I was told 3-6 business days, then it became about 21 days, then 28 business days.  After numerous call to HP Support, I just learned that they are waiting for an unknown part to arrive from somewhere, that won't be received until sometime in June.  Maybe!!  What a company and what a poor effort at communications.  One would think that I would be contacted to see if I wanted to continue to wait for this part or perhaps change one of my features so the computer could be finished and shipped, but NO. Asked the support person, ""well, can you contact the factory and determine what the missing part is"" NO. ""can you contact the factory and determine if they truly expect the part in June"" NO. ""but if I knew which part was the issue, maybe I could change my specs""  NO.  Overall, a huge disappointment and I certainly could not recommend them.  Probably going to cancel order and get refund and hope for the best with someone that actually cares about customer service.

HP,Technology,3 stars: Average,"
                The laptops always seem to have issues. On the other hand I have terrible luck with laptops. I've had 2 arrive faulty (from other companies).  Getting in touch can be quite difficult sometimes. I purchased my laptop at currys and they kept saying on the website that if I bought from currys or dixons that my warranty is with teamknowhow, and that the factory one does not apply which..isn't true? I've never had any evidence of this at all and my laptop came with a factory warranty. Because it's registered as purchased at Currys I kept hitting a wall trying to get help with my severely broken laptop. It wouldn't let me get through to customer service because they knew it was bought at Currys!   A huge piece of metal somehow just came out of the laptop, it was sticking out at all times, very heavy. I don't know where it came from and there was no way of pushing it..back inside or ...anything like that. It was immovable. Utterly bizarre issue I've never encountered haha. On top of that eventually the screen started to crack and crumble! It wasn't dropped, it was spontaneous and I have no clue how that piece of metal physically was sticking out the laptop, there's no giant hole for it.  It was within factory warranty and I contacted HP via facebook if I recall but I was extremely doubtful they'd help me. I thought they would just say I broke it and frankly, I don't know how I would have been physically capable of getting that piece of metal but I know a lot of CS places will do anything to not help you.  That being said, I sent a few pictures, explained the above and HP happily collected my laptop. I was very worried that they would hold my laptop and tell me I need to pay a fortune to get it fixed but they actually fixed it free of charge! It was only gone for 5 days in total!  This is not the first time I have had problems with an HP laptop. My first one the solid state drive was screwed up or something. Was a few years ago so I'm foggy on the specifics. The laptop went incredibly slow and you practically couldn't use it. I had nothing but your standard protective software on it so it was not overloaded with installs. Really only used it for internet. Cleared the cache, removed unnecessary preinstalls. Still, the memory was at almost full use! I had to fight them a little on getting a repair for it but they did free of charge despite being JUST out of warranty. Collected, repaired and returned within about 2 weeks.  Overall, the products are..not the best for me..but I do have bad luck with laptops, can't lie. Out of all laptops I've had HP have been the best customer service wise.  Trying to get through to CS was a bloody nightmare for me with my current laptop being from Currys but when I did get hold of them eventually, they sorted out my issue fantastically and within a very good time frame.   Also have an HP printer that had a couple of issues and HP support took me through sorting the issues out step by step.

                The horrible laptop I have ever used. I bought a personal laptop for $1100, a horrible experience. My employer gave me EliteBook again waste of money and energy. So many problems with audio, Bluetooth drivers.   DO not BUY HP laptops.

                The worst customer service I have had the displeasure of dealing with. My printers ink cartridges aren't working and I have been trying to get them replaced through the warranty for a month. Every time i contact them and speak to someone we somehow lose connection then 5 minutes later I get a email saying my case is closed. I am so sick of going through this with them. I have to keep explaining the damn issue over and over again with no solution. I will never purchase an HP product again.

                This is absolutely terrible. I purchased a brand new laptop a few months ago, and all it has done is give me problems. It is the slowest computer I have ever used. It would make you think that you’re using a computer from 2011. I have used less than 10% of storage, and have taken good care of it, yet it gets slower and slower every day. The customer service is terrible when you try to get help, and the solutions online do not work. Do not buy an HP.

                I am NEVER buying an HP again. They use to be good but now they are total pieces of junk and their customer services is HORRIBLE. My next computer will be a different brand. I've only had HP's for the past 20 years, but I just can't use their junk any more. My last computer was so horrible that I sent it in to be fixed multiple times and they couldn't fix it. It would keep turning itself off. The last time they had it for a month and it was still not being fix so they finally decided to give me store credit even though I only had possession of the computer for a few months, the rest of the time they had it and were working on fixing it. To get them to even accept taking it back to ""fix"" it was days of arguing with them after I had done some factory resets. Then instead of giving me a new computer they only gave me a refund that I had to use in their store. Now the computer I have is also a piece of crap, but I have given up on HP completely so I haven't tried to get it fixed after all the fighting I had to do with the last one. This is my third computer in a row that has been horrible. I am NEVER buying another HP product again. When this computer is dead and I have to shell out more money it will be going somewhere else.

                Absolute trash When you call in, they only allow you to text their bot helper, who is supposed to help or allow you to talk to a person if they can't resolve your issue. They couldn't but my printer is out of warranty so I can't get help. My printer has been printing shadows behind text (a very common issue as I've seen/read many threads asking how to fix it), their suggestion is turn it off and back on again, have you tried cleaning the cartridges? etc and after doing all of that nothing has changed. Seems they simply have faulty products and don't have any options to help or fix it. Waste of time and absolutely frustrating. I'm a freakin 20 something who never leaves reviews/gets this upset, but they've failed entirely at providing any assistance and need to work on customer service/product fixing/having better, actually functional products in general or they really deserve to go under

                I bought an 8010 printer and it came with cartridges. I’ve signed up to the ‘free’ introductory Instant Ink offer and after printing 100 pages, including 20 or do that were just part of printer set up, I’ve received a message that I’m going to be charged per page from now on - using a cartridge that I paid for as it came with my printer! That’s ridiculous  With my old Officejet 6500 I typically replaced the XL cartridges every 2 years and they typically cost £50. In the same period, after the offer ends, Instant Ink will cost a minimum £94.80 PLUS 6.6p per page over 100 per month. My initial impression is now that Instant Ink is a rip-off.

                Spent $1300CAD on a HP touchscreen laptop for it to need to be repaired within the 1st year. 3 years in and it's completely not working, as by the online troubleshooting walk throughs I can see this happens often.  Their customer service is appalling. If we spoke to our customers the way they did after paying thousands of dollars we wouldn't have a job. ""Sorry you don't have warranty anymore we can't help you.""...all I needed assistance with was walking me through a factory reset for this piece of garbage product. Not only will I NEVER purchase an HP item again, I will make sure no family or friends do either.

Please be very careful what you buy from this website as the after sales is terrible once they have your money not a care will be given. Our office has always had hp for our desktops and laptops but after this i will stay away from them like the plauge.

                Nothing but bad experiences with this company, let me go into detail and tell you why:  They sent me the wrong laptop -- twice in a row. First with the wrong monitor, second with the wrong graphics card. Had I not been tech savvy I doubt anyone else would've noticed. It cost me about $50 to have it sent back, despite the fact they sent me the wrong laptop.  You can't cancel orders and you will always have to pay a restocking fee, even if it was their mistake.  They're out to scam you and their support line is the worst of the worst. Avoid this company as much as you can.

                The support is abysmal. I bought an ENVY5000 home printer, the setup was fine but the next day it was not being seen by my Mac at the point of printing even though the printer and computer were online and HP's app was telling me it could see the printer.  I tried to troubleshoot it with a bot and was predictably sent around in circles doing things that were clearly not going to work and which got increasingly technical. You should not need to mess around with servers etc. for two hours or need an IS degree to get a home printer to work.  If I could only find out how to uninstall everything and set it up again from scratch I could have sorted the issue in under half an hour - to get that info. though I would need to be able to speak to a human as the website, app etc. are all as inflexible as the bot support.  The product seems like it is good value if it's working but I'm afraid the support and troubleshootng options are too bad and inflexible. I will never be purchasing any HP hardware again as it is overcomplicated while also offering poor support.  I'm sure there are slightly more expensive options that save a lot of hassle and stress in the long run. I will definitely be purchasing my next printer from a different company.

                Hewlett Packard is by far the worst computer manufacturing company till date in my experience. The company speaks very highly of their products but in reality its the juxtapose. The vendor claimed that the system has a great processor with an updated software when I bought an HP product, but it came to me as a surprise that there is nothing extraordinary about the product. My PC is getting slower day by day. The company really needs to focus on the reason of its existence, being a Human Resource Associate in my company I believe the quality of the product or services delivered by a company defines the quality of people and management of the company.

                I bought an HP Spectre about 2 years ago. A few months ago the sound from the unit came and went. Ear buds continued working. Eventually the sound quit working altogether... and the ear bud sound quit as well. HP tech tested the laptop with me with the result stating the sound worked. In the real world, it did not. HP next advised me to wipe the drive and reinstall everything. I did so and... no sound. Now, the desktop changes format on its own. Wifi disconnects. I checked around and these issues appear common with HP products. My advice... look into HP products and service before buying any product they make.

                The customer service representative I spoke to today was very efficient and understanding but I have been told that because my printer is out of warranty I can either try to figure out the issue I'm having through online forums or by paying £18 for technical support.  Just because an item is out of warranty doesn't mean you should stop providing support. It is forcing consumers to buy new units when they don't need to and it is promoting waste culture. Absolutely zero corporate social responsibility and company ethics at its worst. It is madness and incredibly irresponsible on their part that I have paid for a product and they want me to buy a new unit rather than fix the one I have.

                People look at these reviews before buying HP products. They are utter thieves.  I bought an HP printer &amp; subscribed to the Instant Ink programme. They send you cartridges in the post &amp; it all works fine when they send cartridges that work. However, they sent me a batch that were faulty... they acknowledged the fault but struggled to get me replacements out so I had to go to a store to buy a new set.   I cancelled my direct debit whilst they hadn't sent any working cartridges - SO THEY DISABLED MY PRINTER! I bought genuine HP cartridges from Rymans - but they want me to buy cartridges &amp; pay a subscription i.e. pay twice?!?!?   So a warning don't buy the Instant Ink package (or an HP printer IMO).

                I bought the HP 360 Envy, the laptop can do the basics of what I need but I am going to rip HP apart as a company. It is nothing more than a greedy corporation that doesn't care about its customers. I had this piece of krap for a month and the strap to my laptop carrier broke, and the corner of the laptop where the start button is was bent up and unusable. I purchased a 2-year warranty when I bought the laptop, HP does not honor warranties unless you buy directly from them but since I purchased through BestBuy they wouldn't cover the damage which was 400 for a little bent corner. Hope they go out of business, I will keep steering people clear of the garbage company.

                I placed an online order for my fiances birthday and paid for expedited shipping on Dec. 2. Once I got the confirmation email on Dec. 3 saying the PC was being built, I called immediately to cancel the order because the estimated arrival date was Dec. 17 and I would not get it in time to gift. The customer service rep stated she would submit a request for the cancelation and I would receive an email in 1-3 days. I never got an email about the cancelation; instead i got one on Dec. 9 saying that I picked a great PC. I called again and spoke to a supervisor and she told me she would fast track the request. Then 4 days later (Dec. 13), I got an email saying that my item has shipped. I then called again and spoke to a different supervisor and he told me that he will have the item returned to the sender since I did not want the item and he would refund the order. Come Dec. 17, I received the laptop with no email stating any information from any of the customer service calls (again). I did not realize the PC had to be built and canceled the order 14 days before getting it- even with expedited shipping. I spend an average of 30 min. on the phone during numerous lunch breaks just for nothing to get resolved. After debating going through the trouble of sending the laptop back and having to pay a 15% restocking fee + no refund for expedited shipping, the laptop sat in a box for a couple months and at this point we just decided to keep it. We just started using it and the built in camera has stopped working multiple times. I look up information/videos to fix it and I run into issues in Device Manager, Control Panel and it will start working, just to stop working again within less than a day. The issue is fixed a different way every time and it's hard to even say how since the settings are never the same as I left them. Not only has the laptop not been able to find the camera numerous times, but now the touch screen has not been working and we have been using it for less than a month. This has been my first experience with Hp and will most definitely be my last. I highly DO NOT recommend their products and they have the most horrible customer service I have ever dealt with.

                I guess I should have read the REAL reviews before I wasted my time to order a computer from HP.  I purchased the HP Pavilion 24-xa1008na All-in-One. I understand now why you can't leave a review on their website about their products... they appear to pick reviews manually.  I could probably had a less of a lemon if I ordered random parts from the black markets of Wuhan and assembled them blindfolded.   The desktop came with an AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile (= tech specs didn't specify that it was the mobile version) Gfx, 8Gb and 1Tb drive. Or so I thought.   It was extremely slow even with nothing but factory installations. A simple download of no more than 50MB took anywhere from 30min to 1 hr. Internet would hangs all the time although I've got very fast internet speed and my other computer has no issues at all.  The HP model had 24 outdated drivers and couldn't handle to download and install any of them (I tried for 6 hours). The 1TB drive was allocated not to the C-drive where it's needed the most but to the D-drive while the main C-drive had only 235Gb....  The so called ""Bang Olufsen"" speakers were a joke and powered 50% below average sound quality, and the sound was very poor. I sincerely doubt these speakers can be authentic Bang Olufsen ones.  For almost £800 HP doesn't even offer a recovery partition drive, which every computer I have owned in the past 15 years have. This is a severely outdated brand.   I thought HP was supposed to be one of the best brands out there... it's not even close to being average.

I have to buy a new operating system and computer. I have always bought HP computers. I have to go buy a new computer today and I will tell you it wont be a stinking terrible HP.

                Hewlett Packard is by far the worst computer manufacturing company till date in my experience. The company speaks very highly of their products but in reality its the juxtapose. The vendor claimed that the system has a great processor with an updated software when I bought an HP product, but it came to me as a surprise that there is nothing extraordinary about the product. My PC is getting slower day by day. The company really needs to focus on the reason of its existence, being a Human Resource Associate in my company I believe the quality of the product or services delivered by a company defines the quality of people and management of the company.

                I bought an HP Spectre about 2 years ago. A few months ago the sound from the unit came and went. Ear buds continued working. Eventually the sound quit working altogether... and the ear bud sound quit as well. HP tech tested the laptop with me with the result stating the sound worked. In the real world, it did not. HP next advised me to wipe the drive and reinstall everything. I did so and... no sound. Now, the desktop changes format on its own. Wifi disconnects. I checked around and these issues appear common with HP products. My advice... look into HP products and service before buying any product they make.

                The customer service representative I spoke to today was very efficient and understanding but I have been told that because my printer is out of warranty I can either try to figure out the issue I'm having through online forums or by paying £18 for technical support.  Just because an item is out of warranty doesn't mean you should stop providing support. It is forcing consumers to buy new units when they don't need to and it is promoting waste culture. Absolutely zero corporate social responsibility and company ethics at its worst. It is madness and incredibly irresponsible on their part that I have paid for a product and they want me to buy a new unit rather than fix the one I have.

                People look at these reviews before buying HP products. They are utter thieves.  I bought an HP printer &amp; subscribed to the Instant Ink programme. They send you cartridges in the post &amp; it all works fine when they send cartridges that work. However, they sent me a batch that were faulty... they acknowledged the fault but struggled to get me replacements out so I had to go to a store to buy a new set.   I cancelled my direct debit whilst they hadn't sent any working cartridges - SO THEY DISABLED MY PRINTER! I bought genuine HP cartridges from Rymans - but they want me to buy cartridges &amp; pay a subscription i.e. pay twice?!?!?   So a warning don't buy the Instant Ink package (or an HP printer IMO).

                I bought the HP 360 Envy, the laptop can do the basics of what I need but I am going to rip HP apart as a company. It is nothing more than a greedy corporation that doesn't care about its customers. I had this piece of krap for a month and the strap to my laptop carrier broke, and the corner of the laptop where the start button is was bent up and unusable. I purchased a 2-year warranty when I bought the laptop, HP does not honor warranties unless you buy directly from them but since I purchased through BestBuy they wouldn't cover the damage which was 400 for a little bent corner. Hope they go out of business, I will keep steering people clear of the garbage company.

                I placed an online order for my fiances birthday and paid for expedited shipping on Dec. 2. Once I got the confirmation email on Dec. 3 saying the PC was being built, I called immediately to cancel the order because the estimated arrival date was Dec. 17 and I would not get it in time to gift. The customer service rep stated she would submit a request for the cancelation and I would receive an email in 1-3 days. I never got an email about the cancelation; instead i got one on Dec. 9 saying that I picked a great PC. I called again and spoke to a supervisor and she told me she would fast track the request. Then 4 days later (Dec. 13), I got an email saying that my item has shipped. I then called again and spoke to a different supervisor and he told me that he will have the item returned to the sender since I did not want the item and he would refund the order. Come Dec. 17, I received the laptop with no email stating any information from any of the customer service calls (again). I did not realize the PC had to be built and canceled the order 14 days before getting it- even with expedited shipping. I spend an average of 30 min. on the phone during numerous lunch breaks just for nothing to get resolved. After debating going through the trouble of sending the laptop back and having to pay a 15% restocking fee + no refund for expedited shipping, the laptop sat in a box for a couple months and at this point we just decided to keep it. We just started using it and the built in camera has stopped working multiple times. I look up information/videos to fix it and I run into issues in Device Manager, Control Panel and it will start working, just to stop working again within less than a day. The issue is fixed a different way every time and it's hard to even say how since the settings are never the same as I left them. Not only has the laptop not been able to find the camera numerous times, but now the touch screen has not been working and we have been using it for less than a month. This has been my first experience with Hp and will most definitely be my last. I highly DO NOT recommend their products and they have the most horrible customer service I have ever dealt with.

                I guess I should have read the REAL reviews before I wasted my time to order a computer from HP.  I purchased the HP Pavilion 24-xa1008na All-in-One. I understand now why you can't leave a review on their website about their products... they appear to pick reviews manually.  I could probably had a less of a lemon if I ordered random parts from the black markets of Wuhan and assembled them blindfolded.   The desktop came with an AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile (= tech specs didn't specify that it was the mobile version) Gfx, 8Gb and 1Tb drive. Or so I thought.   It was extremely slow even with nothing but factory installations. A simple download of no more than 50MB took anywhere from 30min to 1 hr. Internet would hangs all the time although I've got very fast internet speed and my other computer has no issues at all.  The HP model had 24 outdated drivers and couldn't handle to download and install any of them (I tried for 6 hours). The 1TB drive was allocated not to the C-drive where it's needed the most but to the D-drive while the main C-drive had only 235Gb....  The so called ""Bang Olufsen"" speakers were a joke and powered 50% below average sound quality, and the sound was very poor. I sincerely doubt these speakers can be authentic Bang Olufsen ones.  For almost £800 HP doesn't even offer a recovery partition drive, which every computer I have owned in the past 15 years have. This is a severely outdated brand.   I thought HP was supposed to be one of the best brands out there... it's not even close to being average.

                Bought an HP laptop, brand new. I was so happy bc it is so fast and reliable. Then it broke down after a month. I was disappointed and came to see HP reviews. Realised there are loads of bad reviews about customer service. I panicked a bit but called HP, I told my problem and they sent a driver to pick the laptop up. 5 days later, they delivered the lap, fixed and cleaned. I think they handled the issue the best they could and I didn’t have to wait long on the phone either. I guess people tend to give bad reviews if they have issues but don’t bother to give feedback if everything is positive so after seeing this loads of bad reviews, I thought it’s the right thing to do that I give my positive feedback about my experience. Mistakes happen, it’s about how you handle them. Nice work HP

                This company is a criminal mastermind, I am sure of it.... Somehow, they manage to be accepted as a legitimate company, selling legitimate products, but they are a SCAM.  They sell products that are almost instantly 'Out of Warranty', and will not provide any form of direct support for them after the 30 minutes of warranty runs out, unless you keep paying them to renew the warranty. This is much like Microsoft, and many other tech companies that do not support their own products unless you constantly make recurring payments to them for support. I made the dire mistake of buying an HP Envy 4520 all in one printer, for my home office setup, and the warranty ran out before i got it home.  *It was supposed to be a Wireless printer, but I ended up having to get a USB cord to plug it in directly for it to work. *It is constantly running low on ink, even if you only printed a couple of pages. *The head alignment is consistently off, and cannot be reset properly using the provided HP Utility app. *The only support they will provide for their equipment is through the community forums, which is a long process of waiting for an answer, if you 'warranty' has expired, which as I said above happens before you can even get the device home from the store. *If you do manage to have 5 minutes left on your 'warranty', and can get direct support, it is from some overseas call center, who can barely speak English, and does not truly know anything about the products. *If you are in my situation, and have a presentation that is later this morning, but cannot print out the necessary documents because of a piece of garbage printer, you must post a question in the forums, and wait for a couple of days to get a response, which will inevitably just be asking for more information.  I need help NOW Hewlett Packard, not eventually....

                I have had HP products for many years and generally would rate them as adequate. However their customer service is the worst I've ever encountered in any industry. I tried to contact them through their weekly (?) promotional emails for over 6 months with no results. I tried to send them direct emails - no results. Over a week ago I called the number in the email and after over an hour on the phone and being transferred 4 times (once back to someone I had already talked to) I was assured that my problem would be/was taken care of. It has not! I am now currently on hold for over an hour. I appreciate that currently there may a high volume of calls but shouldn't a company that wants to respond to customer's enquiries, give you an estimate of how long you'll be on hold and/or allow you to leave a message or allow you to leave your number to be called back.

Now HP was telling me I had to file a lost package report with Canada Post. So ensued finger-pointing of Canada Post, the receptionist who signed for the packages and HP sitting in the distance indifferent and unhelpful. Finally, I called HP back to complain about the whole process which I found ridiculous. Dealing with customer service is painful. Asked to speak with a Supervisor. The Supervisor tells me that the PC is actually on backorder, so they offer me a different PC, but then it takes 3 days to confirm a price. Ultimately, I canceled the order and now it will take a month to get a refund. Went to the local Memory Express and picked up a great PC same-day, better price, better quality. I've had many bad experiences with HP Printers in the past, but this takes the cake. Totally useless company...

It's my own fault however that does not take away from the fact that it is terribly slow. Fortunately, I do not need it for work.

I can't find the support phone number anywhere on their website because they want me to use the virtual assistant. The virtual assistant didn't have the answer that I needed for my question. I searched up and down their website looking for a phone number and could not find one. so I went to a different website that specializes in contact phone numbers for support, when those companies don't want you to call support. I finally get the phone number and call and go through the thousands of options I have to choose through (voice activated by the way which is always annoying, it's so much easier to just hit 1 or 2, etc) and after about 10 minutes of that, I find out that they charge you $20 just to talk to a tech support person if your product is out of warranty. I bought this printer back in like 2016. Like legitimately I'm just trying to find the PIN number for my printer. What the hell?! I would give them zero stars if I could.

                ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!!! I purchased a hp 5230 all in one printer in March of 2019. No end of trouble....instant ink is a right old rip off, so I bought my own cartridges from Currys. WELL, surprise sur chuffing prise.... The two 302 XL cartridges that I've paid £30+ each for, are, according to the useless contraption, outdated for my machine!!!! This is despite the fact that the sticker inside the printer carrier reads '302'. SO, I'm now left with a printer that I cannot use. What a total waste of money. I would not touch a hp anything with a barge pole.

                HP has very poor customer support. I had a problem with my printer where it could not scan despite attempts to resetting connection. I contacted HP support for help and after a week, a female employee contacted me to follow up on my enquiry. I told her the problem has been solved through the forum where someone suggested to download the scanner software. I am appalled that HP took too long to offer help but still unable to suggest any possible remedy. I would not recommend HP products to anyone nor purchasing anymore equipment from this manufacturer.

                Disgraceful. My laptop that is less than 2 months old was sent for repair due to an over heating issue on the 6th Feb via Currys PC world Limerick. I spent 2 hours in store and requested a replacement laptop but was advised that you would not give one as it was over 1 month old. The issues with my laptop started almost immediately after purchase (which you should have a log of) however as the laptop was unfamiliar to me I was unaware that there was anything wrong which is why I didn't return it sooner. I was also advised that my laptop was now discontinued and that my only option was a repair. I reluctantly agreed. I was advised I would have it back in about 6 days. I've just been told it wasn't collected until the 15th so it won't be delivered to your repair team until the 22nd. After that they can't tell me how long it will be before I get it.  It is disgraceful that you can sell a laptop that malfunctions almost immediately and not replace it with a laptop of the same spec.

                HP does not stand behind their products. I had a 2 year warranty with HP and my laptop broke 2 months before that expired.  They kept me on the phone with customer service and kept asking me to do tasks that took overnight to complete until the warranty was about to expire. They then said I would have to extend the warranty to continue to have the product repaired. Then, when I paid over $200 to extend it, they sait it was now a pre-existing problem and they wouldn't help me. Not only was I cheated out of my warranty, but they stole from me in the process.  NEVER buy anything from HP.

                Dealing with HP is an exercise in frustration.  Sent laptop (HP Pavilion cs0997 Laptop) which had a damaged screen to them under warranty. The laptop was returned to us even more damaged than when we sent it to them.   We bought the laptop from John Lewis with a 2 year warranty.  Both John Lewis and HP did nothing to help with the situation.  I used to think that John Lewis warranties were iron clad but this is not the case .  Buyer beware.

                Oh wow.  All I want is a new ink cartridge under the instant ink contract.  a) there is no option in any of the software programs to do this b) they ask you to talk to the virtual assistant c) the virtual assistant is unable to help and runs around in circles with ""suggestions"" d) finally find a real person e) turns out not in the same country so unable to help f) best offer is a phone number that is staffed until 6pm and absolutely no after hours help  This has now cost me 1.5 hours of my life which I am never getting back, and the problem is not solved.

                I purchased an All-One PC for my son and I to use.  I contacted HP prior to purchase to confirm the computer could accommodate what we each were looking to do.  They advised that yes it could.  I ordered the computer 12/19, received it 12/31/2020 and set it up.  Downloaded a game my son wanted to play and within 10 minutes of playing it the screen began to flicker between the game and a black screen.  Then the screen went black entirely.  Tried a different game, same thing happened.  I specifically asked if the graphics on this computer could handle these games and was told yes.  Now they are saying it can't.  So I guess they tell you what you want to hear to get you to buy their computers.  This is the last HP computer I will purchase.  I have a warranty and the extended care package and when I contacted customer service, they told me I have to PAY for assistance.  The customer service rep was rude, just trying to rush me away and didn't want to be bothered to try to assist me.  Just kept telling me I had to pay for help!!! What is the point of a warranty and care package, if they won't assist?! And as a side note, I reviewed their product on their website but it was removed, they only show the positive reviews so beware.

                Absolutely terrible product and customer service.   I got a HP ENVY photo 6234 printer last year which came with HP instant ink subscription service. I assumed that the instant ink service would be a convenience. Instead it has been a NIGHTMARE, your printer must always be connect to network and the server. If HP servers are down, then you can't print anything even if u have wifi and electricity (I experienced this during the peak of my work projects). When the ink was low, I did not receive any ink for my subscription, desperate to print my documents, I bought my own ink from Currys PC .... and HP Instant ink now charges me for ink I bought myself.   When you try to get help from customer service, there is no clear number or email to contact. So I had to use their facebook profile to get a response. Again, disappointing. Unclear solutions and waste of time. 3 days back and forth on messenger, they repeat the same questions I have answered and in the end of the day have not solved anything.   Save yourself the time and stress , avoid their products !

                Have had my HP 3750 Deskjet for almost a year so it's still under warranty. I haven't used it that much. But recently have needed to print a number of documents and have had print errors or not printing at all. The Virtual Agent is a complete waste of time and when you do need to speak to someone you are directed to WhatsApp or Messenger. Why can we not talk to a human being. This is customer service at it's worst. A true measure of a good company is how they deal with problems, and HP's aftercare is not even worth the one star.

They have a quick turnaround on products and couldn't cancel the first laptop in time, which is understandable. I called in and was told that it was no problem, that I could just return to sender and get a refund. Great! Ordered the laptop I meant to get.  I then noticed the address didn't have my house number (not sure if my fault or not but eh). Called them up again, the lady that responded was really helpful, told the delivery company to just return to sender instead of trying to deliver and giving them my address so the other laptop could get here.   So far all working smoothly, expecting a refund for the mistake purchase once it gets back to HP.

                I purchased a one year extension HP Warranty in December and it did not get automatically updated on the system, despite what the invoice contract stated.   After a few weeks of great frustration, an update was confirmed through using HP connected via Whatsapp which seemed to be much more successful than email enquiries - a real person at the other end has confirmed that all details have been updated.   I will wait to see if that is true.   Watch Out For This:  Only thing is my original purchase warranty was valid till June 2020, BUT as I bought a year's extension in December 2019, my total warranty is now valid from date of purchase not date of warranty expiry - i.e. warranty valid till December 2020.   This means I lost six months warranty time... I should have waited before purchasing the extension.  So be warned not to spend your money too early if you decide to spend it at all.

I didn't know companies in this modern day could make a product that couldnt impress a mentally handicap donkey from the jurrasic period. This HP laptop cant even delete 20mb files in less than 10 ducking minuets. The laptop is brand new, has been checked for viruses and my WIFI is running smoothly which doesn't even matter because im deleting already downloaded stuff. HP could burn to the ground and it would be no great loss. Inserting toothpicks under my toe nails and kicking a wall would be more pleasurable than using this laptop.

I can actually get the job done about that often. Recently I've been concerned that the HP 4630 is self aware.

                HI everyone please beware of the warranty and services provided by HP India. They only try to fraud and extract money out of you. There services are pathetic and even there engineers are not qualified.  I bought my HP SPECTRE laptop from USA with 1 year of International warranty. At the end i decided to get it checked, it was working fine so the engineers suggested for an extended International warranty of 2 years for 14K so i opted for it. later my laptop showed some glitches so I called on the service center first they tried to solve it online but when it didn't work i asked for a home visit. After which people in the service center told me that it is not possible as my Laptop was bought Internationally. I mean if it cannot be serviced in India how could you charge for an extended warranty. So i asked them for the return, but then they said fine we'll send someone for a home visit.   After 2-3 days the guy came and told me that my motherboard needs to be replaced. I said ok and asked him several times if he's sure that he can get the same motherboard in India or else there's no need to replace the original motherboard but he said yes it is available and that my laptop will be as good as new again.  After that these people have been mentally harassing me for  5 months. They take my laptop return it back with unresolved issues. and they changed the motherboard number of times and kept on trying refurbished motherboard again and again. Now after all the stupid efforts and 5 months of torture they have come to a conclusion that they'll return the 14K back after spoiling my laptop and disposing my original motherboard.They made me a fool and after all this they are saying we cannot do anything about it. And now it has come to a point were i have decided to file a complaint againt these people.  So It is my humble request to all the HP users in INDIA please beware of these fraud people they claim to help you but they only believing in extracting money and torturing people. Please don't Buy any HP product.

                When you buy an HP printer, they will do everything they can to persuade/cajole you into signing up for HP Instant Ink, which is supposed to monitor your ink levels and automatically send you new cartridges when they run low.  After 2 years of paying $10/month and them only sending me replacements once--13 months ago--my yellow ink ran completely dry and they claimed I still had another one unused.  So I didn't pay and let them ""suspend"" the account.  Now they remotely locked my printer from printing and the printer directs me to log into the Instant Ink website to fix the problem.  The only way to get them to release my hostage printer is start paying them again, even though they STILL won't send me new ink because they claim I still have some unused... Now I ordered my own ink (generic, not HP, b/c F those guys!), and according to everything I'm reading, I'll still have to click an extra ""OK"" for each print job acknowledging the ink isn't ""Instant Ink!"" * 2/14/2020 Update: The generic ink works great, but I got an email yesterday from HP saying ""Thanks for updating your account info!"" which I hadn't.  They charged my credit card again, pretending I hadn't explicitly stated during a 1-hour chat with customer disservice that I will never do business with them again.  So I wasted another hour on chat, and got them to refund that charge, after which they said I'd now be charged for 2 other months, and still not get any ink for it.  So I reported the charges to my bank as fraudulent and canceled the credit card.  Go suck blood from a different turnip, HP!

                When I plug-in two external HD one of them disconnect without any reason and in an unsafe way. This happens very frequently but not always. It happens more frequently at the second attempt, after disconnecting one of the hard disks with the recommended safe removal icon.  The disconnection occurred so frequently that caused me a big loss of data because many of the files I have on the external disk were corrupted. I didn’t receive any error message and many times probably I didn’t even notice it because the sound was silent. So I didn’t worried about the problem for a long time and I overwrite the good files in my backup with new corrupted files. This happened casually to pictures, pdf files, video so I’m not able to distinguish the damaged files and the good ones without trying to open them. The problem is very serious, and I would expect HP to approach it seriously unlike it did when I first send the notebook to the assistence.  The problem usually happens when I plug my second external HD that I use for backup while I use an external SDD for the data. But I also verified it happens with others mechanical hard disk. Here is a list of what I already tried to fix the problem and what I discovered by trials: 1.	I changed the case of the external HDD and the cables. 2.

                My HP Printer now will only accept genuine ink so $250 is now $900 for ink.  What's better is Australia is not even on the list to contact and get help and only automated system for support.  Never will i buy HP again. Very Disgusting Oh they worked last year and now a new update the blocked it.

                HP's purchasing practice is a disaster. I will never order another product from HP. They have a practice of taking your money from your account immediately when placing an order. If anything goes wrong and the order doesn't go through it takes weeks and multiple phone calls to get them to put the money back. It took them 2 weeks and I had to make 3 phone calls and 2 conference calls with my credit card company before they finally figured out that they had to put the money back not the credit card company - sheez. I've been discouraged with the competency of the people in their sales support group. Do your self a favor and buy from anyone but HP. Been nothing but a nightmare each time I've tried to purchase from them. Never again.

                My computer just hit a year old. I had a year warranty on it. I tried to get it fixed inside my warranty gap and they tried hard to get out and see me kept bringing the wrong parts. After 3 months of them bringing the wrong parts and not getting back to me.My year was up and they told me that warranty doesn't cover it because their guys screwed up and waited too long. Now I have to pay for a fix that was covered and I had it inside the warranty. They took too long on purpose so I would have to pay but I feel like I just got cheated out of my warranty because they kept messing up. What should have been a free fix for me now will cost me $480. Used to recommend people to HP not anymore.

                Do not trust HP. I recently brought a printer [Deskjet 3700 All in one] from them which I thought was rather cheap and decent for the price. The printer worked fine for one day and the next started making misprints and missed words out. Now it won't even print anything nor accept any paper. And talk about All in One, the Scanner just stops scanning halfway through. Disappointing. I'll remember to get a Dell next time as I've never had an issues with those.

No live chat on website, only a virtual assistant. I googled ""how to speak to a person at HP"" and only the toll free US number came up. I tried that and over the course of 7 calls I got dropped once. I was given 5 different UK numbers to call. 4 of which are not recognised and the real number just rings continuously and then drops the call. Also on one of the calls the agent took my laptop model, where i'm calling from then just said he would ""look into this"" without asking why i was calling. Muted the call and took off his headset for 5 mins so I was calling down the phone to no reply.   I have yet to speak to someone at HP about my query and none of the telephone numbers I have been given work. The only real number is found by googling ""HP technical support number"" but this is the one that rings and then hangs up.  How do you speak to these people???

                When I plug-in two external HD one of them disconnect without any reason and in an unsafe way. This happens very frequently but not always. It happens more frequently at the second attempt, after disconnecting one of the hard disks with the recommended safe removal icon.  The disconnection occurred so frequently that caused me a big loss of data because many of the files I have on the external disk were corrupted. I didn’t receive any error message and many times probably I didn’t even notice it because the sound was silent. So I didn’t worried about the problem for a long time and I overwrite the good files in my backup with new corrupted files. This happened casually to pictures, pdf files, video so I’m not able to distinguish the damaged files and the good ones without trying to open them. The problem is very serious, and I would expect HP to approach it seriously unlike it did when I first send the notebook to the assistence.  The problem usually happens when I plug my second external HD that I use for backup while I use an external SDD for the data. But I also verified it happens with others mechanical hard disk. Here is a list of what I already tried to fix the problem and what I discovered by trials: 1.	I changed the case of the external HDD and the cables. 2.	I verified the problem doesn’t happens with those HD on another Pc. So it is not a problem with the external HD. 3.	I scanned the whole system with avira Antivirus 4.	I brought the notebook to a shop and they verified the problem happens also with HD others than mine, and sometimes also with usb pendrive or external DVD 5.	The technician in the shop verified that the problem happens also with Windows 8 on a bootable pendrive 6.	I send the notebook to the HP assistence, they send it back stating they changed the motherboard (lying???) and made a system recovery. After some time of use and installing again all the program I discovered the problem still happens 7.	I tried to use the HDs with an external USB hub with independent power supply to check if the problem was just electric.  8.	I told everything again to the HP support but they keep saying it must be a software problem. 9.	I made again a system recovery to factory condition and formatted the external HDs but the problem is still there.  Apparently, the problem is not detected with the HP diagnostic software and that’s how they deny there is any hardware problem. According to everything I explained above the only explanation instead is that there is a hardware problem in the notebook and the motherboard hadn’t been changed or either it is a systematic problems of HP motherboard.

                So as most reviews on this garbage company mine is similar. Bought a laptop which was not a very great product to begin with. Overpriced and cheaply made. And conveniently 3 days after the laptops warranty expired I get a pop up message from hp support to restart my laptop. This message i had never seen before so i restart and then bam. It forces me to do a factory restore no other option. Then when the software attempts to reinstall it constantly gives an error message at the end and forces me to do it again.   So i get a hold of hp support and because of the 3 days operation i now have to pay 60$ just get the problem looked at it. Wether they can fix it or not. Or i have to sign up to their tech support group for 20$ a month. And the person on the phone could hardly be considered well spoken. A lot of backgrounds noise, dude had a thick accent and had the understanding of the English language as an elementary schooler. Just no help And I have a strong feeling that even if I paid into their support crap I still would not get the help I need.

                I bought an expensive (on sale for $500, regular $800) laptop from HP.com in late November 2019.  Big mistake.  If the laptop was actually ok, there wouldn't have been a problem.  Unfortunately, the screen was defective, in that it always had a bright bluish tint that made viewing white/off-white colors difficult and also caused headaches.  After trying everything (and I really mean everything) possible, the problem remained.  I chatted with HP's tech support.  Eventually, after going through everything I had already tried, they said to send the laptop in for service (something that would take weeks or longer to deal with). I didn't want to do that, and asked to just return the laptop, since I had only had the laptop for about 12 days.   The tech guy said I had to contact HP sales for that.  So, I start over. I contacted HP sales.  I go through many back &amp; forths with them via email. They apparently only have one regular sales representative, named Barbara (no last name or initial), though since her emails sometimes lack basic English writing skills, I think ""Barbara"" may be whoever answers my latest email. (However, during the worst of the communications, someone with the name Kat P [I'm not kidding] briefly took over from ""Barbara""). They ask for a case number that was never offered in any of my inquiries/chats.  I have to prove my case by sending screenshots of my chat with HP's tech guy. I ask them why they don't have their own copies of my chats with their tech support, but they never answer that question. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE SCREENSHOTS WHEN YOU CHAT WITH HP. I eventually (with my screenshots) am able to prove my case and get HP to authorize a return.  Yay!  I go to the hp.com website and submit a review for the laptop I had purchased, stating the problems I've had with HP and recommending that buyers buy their HP products from physical stores that accept returns.  A day later, HP sends me a notice that my review didn't meet their website guidelines and was not posted.  No big surprise, I guess.   I had a problem with the HP laptop I purchased.  It was probably a one-time problem, and not something most HP laptop purchasers would have to deal with. Probably, HP's products are as good as any other brands available for purchase.  But the problems they caused me when I tried to return the laptop, and their removal of my negative review from their website, have really turned me off.  No more HP products for me.

                In Short: 1. Faulty laptops with hardware problems. I got 4 to 5 bluescreens everyday. Faulty speakers. Suddenly stop working. 2. Extremely poor postsales support and long waiting times on calls. Replacement takes alot of time and effort. You’ll be calling every other day for updates on your case. 3. I was offered a repair for a brand new laptop. Do not agree to it. Ask for a replacement.  Boxing sale is coming up and you might find their deals very enticing. I purchased a spectre on black friday and recieved a faulty laptop right out the box. Its almost been a month and im still waiting for my replacement. If you have the patience to call hp everday and demand for a solution then be my guest and buckle up for a miserable experience. I had continuous blue screen errors even after all their troubleshooting and updates. The speakers stopped working too at times, until they started giving a hissing sound. I would highly suggest spending your hard earned money elsewhere if you want something that’s reliable and actually works. So far ive spent 20+ hours on call and that just helped me to get my laptop shipped after 20 days. And this was after being told for a whole week that your return label will be sent within 2 days(3 times). Im still to wait for another 10 days for the new one 😂  Bear in mind this was supposed to be their premium laptop. I would never recommend this brand to any friend or family and its been a horrible experience.   You’ve been warned! I will say however that the support staff is very polite. The only problem is that your issue takes forever to resolve. Nobody has that much time to spend on call. Luckily i had my hollidays.    EDIT: Okay. So ive waited another two weeks and i still didn’t get my laptop. Basically its almost been 45 DAYS for replacement of a faulty laptop. And upon calling them again i found out that even 14 days after receiving my laptop HP had not even processed the replacement for shipping back.  They now have both the laptop and my money and im stuck 😂 I don’t have time to deal with this stupid company anymore. I couldn’t get any work done this past month, and its very frustrating. Save yourself people. Good laptops can be bought from other brands but the customer service can not. Its been a terrible experience and HP has had the worst customer service I’ve seen in my life. Pathetic.

                HP are uncontactable - there is no complaints process, they just pass you off to a virtual robot or the 'community page'.   I have had a very disappointing experience with my HP Envy Printer 6230. The first problem is that the printer has had continuous connection issues right from when I first purchased it. For a printer that boasts that you 'don't need to use a USB cable to connect to your Photo 6230', I feel after my experience with it proves otherwise.   I have experienced problems such as how it often prints very slowly (sometimes taking up to 15 minutes to print a single page). It frequently started to print a page then stop halfway through leaving half a page blank (which is especially frustrating when printing on expensive HP photo paper). Sometimes it does not even respond when jobs are sent to it even though the printer's display says it is connected, it appears as 'idle' or 'unavailable' on my computer.  Another issue that I have been having with the printer is the very poor quality of printing. I have many examples of this but I will list two recent ones below:  On 11/12/19, I wasted four sheets of 5x7 photo paper trying to print a photo. When printing the first image, it gave up halfway through and left half the page blank. The other images printed with a very bizarre yellow-grey tint. It also took over 15 minutes to print a single photo on 4x6 paper, which it only printed half of again. The device said that the ink should be replaced but the connection to my computer was so poor, I could not see the supply levels so both cartridges were changed and aligned (using even more of my monthly pages up). ￼ On 17/12/19, I attempted to print off a coloured page with images and text. It did so with discoloured lines and smears across the page. It was also very slow and took over 10 minutes to print a single A4 page. Due to the smears and poor print quality, I realigned the cartridges, cleaned the back of the printer heads and cleaned the page smear using HP Utility. I attempted to print this page off several times and it was still discoloured and had strange lines down the images. One page even printed off in black and white with loads of the text missing. I wasted a total of 15 pages on HP instant ink attempting to print off this one page. I would have attached images but I could not find a complaint form which would allow me to do this.  Since first having this printer, I have spoken to many agents on web-chats but these issues are still not resolved and I have them every time I switch the printer on, wasting my money, my monthly page allowance and my very expensive photo paper and card. I waste an average of 20+ pages a month either trying to fix the printer of because it has printed pages in poor quality/not completed jobs properly. I am furious at HP and fed up of trying to sort my printer out every time I want to use it.  AVOID HP AT ALL COSTS

                I purchased an HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw Wireless Multifunction Printer with Fax - HP Store UK and exactly two months after I did so the scanner function started to fail. I spent eight hours with their Tech Support trying to fix the problem but to no avail. Then not long after while I was still trying to fix the latter problem the fuser unit and the low voltage power supply failed so I was told. I pursued HP over this matter and said that as the machine was only three months old and it now had three things wrong should it not be replaced. I was told it had to be repaired and if I did manage to get a replacement it would have to be a reconditioned one. I then had an e-mail to say that I had refused the repair which was nonsense. Once I had discovered they had blocked me from having a repair, I contacted HP again and a repair was arranged. As my work is in a home-office environment I made it clear to their booking clerk that anybody attending had to be not allergic to cats nor a smoker. When the engineer and his assistant arrived the former said he was allergic to cats and the latter was quite obviously a heavy smoker. I tried to stop them coming in but they pushed their way past me and headed for where the printer was. The engineer was then very rude to me and left the site and sent a report further insulting me and my premises. Suffice it to say the machine is still not fixed. The moral at the end of this story is avoid HP products at all costs and their service company called Hemmersbach.

                UPDATE - 27th December - Christmas come and gone HP still have not refunded or even apologised. This morning I have received an automated message saying the refund has now been actioned and will be with myself in a further 8 working days. I hope this note stops others experiencing what has happened to us.  Warning - Do not purchase HP Spectre x360 2in1, especially directly from HP Online Store.  - FYI I am still waiting and now a new excuse. Truly awful post sales and no means to escalate.   Over the black Friday weekend, I purchased about £2000, worth of laptop and accessories for work purposes. This included the HP Spectre x360 13 and  5 accessories. I received the products in a timely manner and from there on it has been an awful experience.  1. The laptop overheated within 20 minutes of powering up, this was with nothing running other than Chrome and installing updates.  2. The machine had not been updated since Apr'20. Meaning I was actually sent a laptop at least 8 months old. 3. On returning the product, HP took 4 days to arrange a pick up, it has not been 8 days and am still awaiting a refund.  The post sales team just churn out chatbot type answers, and have no empathy that the customer is out of pocket.  I regret not reading the reviews about HP aftercare service and support. If you are used to Apple then this is like going back in time when companies did not give a damn about the customer.  Avoid HP if you want to get trustworthy product and service

                All I needed was a new power cable within the warrantied timeframe. I called and they said they could easily send it but couldn't process it now because they had a system update and would call me back in 1 or 2 hours. They of course never called. I called back the next day and have been on the phone for over an hour getting transferred from person to person. They keep saying they can easily process this order but it took them a half-hour of me on the phone to do so. Hopefully, my new power cable actually arrives. I also tried to chat with a virtual agent as they suggest over the phone but it just stopped responding and never answered any questions.   I've always purchased HP products but will certainly avoid doing so from now on.

                HP is one of the worst companies to deal with.  I ordered the ENVY desktop.  I had a customized order... they forgot to put the speakers into the desktop... so I call them, they will replace it, however they NEED TO CHARGE ME FOR ANOTHER $600 DESKTOP!!!  Once I get the correct desktop and send the one without the speakers back, then they will credit my card for the cost of 1 desktop!!  A week before Christmas and they want payment for 2 desktops to FIX THEIR ERROR!!!  i am going to write reviews all over the internet to stop people from buying from them!!  The company could have said --we will send the new desktop and if you don't send the first desktop back, then we will charge your card for it...  The customer service person didn't even miss a beat when I told her I was sending it back and would buy from another company!!  She said I will send you the return ticket for the desktop to be sent back......  POS COMPANY

                First time ordering my ink cartridges directly from HP Canada. When I received my package there was only 2 out of 3 ink cartridges and the packing slip said 3 were packed. I called customer service and they kept me on hold for a very long time then said they have to investigate and I should get an email within 24-48 hrs. Nothing! I called again, left in hold for long time then said the same thing they have to investigate and shld get an email within 24-48 hrs Nothing! So I emailed sales and they said I need to check with Canada Post - no, the package was sealed tightly. The problem came from whoever was in charge of packaging. They said they need to investigate but will now take 10-15 days! Most companies apologize and send the missing item right away!! Now I have to wait 2-3 weeks for an answer and can’t print and I have already paid for these ink cartridges... shame on you HP!!

This is where the problem begins. HP requested photos to assess the laptop and advise what course of action I should take, they have basically told me it is my problem and they will not cover the repair, I asked to be put further up the line to talk to someone but was given the same blunt answer that it is my fault, then they offered to repair it and do the labour for free, they wanted me to pay for the parts, the parts estimate was $300, I found the parts online for around $100 so I can only assume they wanted to get their labour fee paid for also. I have had numerous contacts with their warranty service  with no success and having the same thing repeated to me every time like a broken record, I can only assume that is what they are taught at the  GFY warranty school at HP, I have looked online and found numerous laptops made by HP with hinge issues and various complaints regarding this issue but I have been told that my laptop is not one of the ones suffering from this issue, surprise surprise. So in closing if you want to buy a laptop and want any sort of after sales service or quality ""STAY AWAY FROM HEWLETT PACKARD""!!!! this has been the worst experience I have ever had with any purchase I have ever made in the 50 years I have been on the planet, I have had numerous laptops over the years and never had such a flimsy poorly constructed piece of s**t before.

                HP compnay!~~!?? So xxxxxxx bad service I recently had experience for canceling my order.  I bought laptop, HP Pavilion 15z because it was on sale On Black Friday.  However, I made a mistake that I did not read carefully with description on CPU that this laptop has AMD on it.  I called customer service talked to Maria Stuart (I don't think that she gave me a real name) to get full refund because it was not even started on assembling when I check my order status.  I called and talked to her and she said that it is already being built. I am pretty sure that she was lying, trained by her manager, don't get any refunds or returns. I ordered roughly 2 hours ago, and they got all the parts and started on ??  This is ridiculous.  I have all the records that I need to prove that when I ordered and when I made a call to cancel.  I tried different customer services even chat on line. All the customer service reps are saying that I have to wait and it is not guaranteed to get canceled.  I have previous experience on HP products and I liked it. However, customer service was horrible. It turned me down so hard.  Read carefully or you have to take the product no matter what. Once they get the money transferred, you will not get refund  HP company has horrible customer services.

                I recently purchased the HP Pavilion x360 14-dh0025na Convertible Laptop and I am thoroughly disappointed with it.  One day after using it, the laptop began to make a lot of noise especially when I began to charge it. It continued to make these loud noises which would be expected from an old laptop (maybe 4/5 years old) however this was a brand new laptop! Upon reporting this to the hp store, I got it exchanged however, the second laptop is exactly the same and noisy which makes one wonder what's wrong with the laptop.

                What on Earth has happened to this once great brand? I'm a HP business partner and supplied a colour Laserjet All in One to a cistomer 6 weeks ago. It's been playing up from day 1 and now is finally dead. Calls to HP warranty had them pretending they needed the suppliers invoice from the Channel reseller, not the end user invoice, then the customer was told she'd get a second hand replacement for her 50 print weeks old brand new printer. Eventually I stepped in and haven ow been waiting 3 days for their ""customer relations"" team to actually speak to me. After 48 hours they left a message whilst I was on the phone. The message stated I could not call them back and had to wait for them to call me again. Almost 36 hours later, 3 emails and 2 calls to HP Warranty, who also claim to be unable to talk to their customer relations team, I'm still waiting. It's quite clear leaving a voicemail allows them to ignore you for another 48 hours, from their French based ""UK Customer Relations"" Office. Edit - 6 days on and I finally get a call from their customer relations, who basically tell me I've been wasting my time. I now need to buy the customer a new replacement at my expense and will have to take the second hard warranty exchange unit in return. That's me and HP finished. 15 years as a business partner but your customer service now stinks. I couldn't treat my customers that way and stay in business, so won't be helping yours any longer.

                I've had Hewlett Packard (HP) printers before - and they were fine. However, I got fed up running out of ink and decided to join their subscription ink service. Unfortunately, the two HP printers I owned were not compatible and I needed to buy a new model. All was OK for a few weeks, then it began dropping the wireless connection. This would happen four or five times every evening. Initially, I thought my BT was the problem, but I checked it out and all was good It became clear that the HP Envy was dropping connection because it was being sent firmware updates from HP's ink servers and would crash every time. I logged a complaint with HP, escalating through first line, tech support and finally customer relations management. After many lengthy calls and doing everything they asked, they finally sent me another printer - but within weeks of arrival, it began doing the same thing, I complained again, and ended up talking to a Max F - who said I had to do a firmware update using a USB cable - I argued that a wireless printer shouldn't need a USB update. He closed the complaint. I reopened it - he closed it again.  I didn't use the printer much but finally I got so fed up, I bought a USB cable and did the firmware upgrade - it failed!! SO I reopened the complaint. After much faffing about they finally sent me a new printer - but it wasn't new - it was a repaired 2nd hand model. I said I wanted a new printer - they referred me to their T&amp;C's. I referred them to the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 - that clearly stipulates that if a replacement for a faulty item is subsequently found to be defective - then I have a right to full refund OR ""a price reduction if you wish to keep the product"" The 'gentleman' from HP said 'Don't care' take it or leave it - and when I said I wanted a new printer or a reduced price and access to the ink service - he closed the case and hung up. It's not over until the fat lady sings and I'm getting really annoyed now.....!!! If you have a choice - Avoid HP - their CRM's are high handed, rude, and are not UK based -  when I declined to accept his omnipotence and asked for escalation, said he was the end of the line...he clearly doesn't know me, p.s. I gave one star because I don't think I can give no stars - caveat emptor

They eventually agreed and collected the faulty laptop.......4 WEEKS ago and I am still waiting for my £500 back!  101 excuses as to why they haven't given me my refund.  THIS IS THEFT IN MY BOOK. So I have decided to take them to court to recover my money.    Trading Standards need to intervene and look at the way this company operates.

When I called HP to inquire why they were sending me old stock their only reply was I had two choices return the product or take a chance that they will last.so I decided to ask for a return label to return the product since I paid close to $300 for them. I have now been waiting 3 weeks to get a return label to return the product every time I call they tell me they will send it this has been the fourth time I've called.

I tried different customer services even chat on line. All the customer service reps are saying that I have to wait and it is not guaranteed to get canceled.  I have previous experience on HP products and I liked it. However, customer service was horrible. It turned me down so hard.  Read carefully or you have to take the product no matter what. Once they get the money transferred, you will not get refund  HP company has horrible customer services.

                I purchased a HP laptop in September of 2018. November 2019, the touch screen was acting up.  I called customer support to find out I had to PAY to talk to someone!  Absolutely RIDICULOUS to have to pay to speak with support after you've purchased their product!  DO NOT purchase from HP.  The laptop I purchased is JUNK, broke after 14 months.  My previous laptop from Sony (which I purchased this one to replace)   lasted 7 years, and is still working.  HP lasted 14 months.  JUNK!  Beware!

One day after using it, the laptop began to make a lot of noise especially when I began to charge it. It continued to make these loud noises which would be expected from an old laptop (maybe 4/5 years old) however this was a brand new laptop! Upon reporting this to the hp store, I got it exchanged however, the second laptop is exactly the same and noisy which makes one wonder what's wrong with the laptop.

                What on Earth has happened to this once great brand? I'm a HP business partner and supplied a colour Laserjet All in One to a cistomer 6 weeks ago. It's been playing up from day 1 and now is finally dead. Calls to HP warranty had them pretending they needed the suppliers invoice from the Channel reseller, not the end user invoice, then the customer was told she'd get a second hand replacement for her 50 print weeks old brand new printer. Eventually I stepped in and haven ow been waiting 3 days for their ""customer relations"" team to actually speak to me. After 48 hours they left a message whilst I was on the phone. The message stated I could not call them back and had to wait for them to call me again. Almost 36 hours later, 3 emails and 2 calls to HP Warranty, who also claim to be unable to talk to their customer relations team, I'm still waiting. It's quite clear leaving a voicemail allows them to ignore you for another 48 hours, from their French based ""UK Customer Relations"" Office. Edit - 6 days on and I finally get a call from their customer relations, who basically tell me I've been wasting my time. I now need to buy the customer a new replacement at my expense and will have to take the second hard warranty exchange unit in return. That's me and HP finished. 15 years as a business partner but your customer service now stinks. I couldn't treat my customers that way and stay in business, so won't be helping yours any longer.

                I've had Hewlett Packard (HP) printers before - and they were fine. However, I got fed up running out of ink and decided to join their subscription ink service. Unfortunately, the two HP printers I owned were not compatible and I needed to buy a new model. All was OK for a few weeks, then it began dropping the wireless connection. This would happen four or five times every evening. Initially, I thought my BT was the problem, but I checked it out and all was good It became clear that the HP Envy was dropping connection because it was being sent firmware updates from HP's ink servers and would crash every time. I logged a complaint with HP, escalating through first line, tech support and finally customer relations management. After many lengthy calls and doing everything they asked, they finally sent me another printer - but within weeks of arrival, it began doing the same thing, I complained again, and ended up talking to a Max F - who said I had to do a firmware update using a USB cable - I argued that a wireless printer shouldn't need a USB update. He closed the complaint. I reopened it - he closed it again.  I didn't use the printer much but finally I got so fed up, I bought a USB cable and did the firmware upgrade - it failed!! SO I reopened the complaint. After much faffing about they finally sent me a new printer - but it wasn't new - it was a repaired 2nd hand model. I said I wanted a new printer - they referred me to their T&amp;C's. I referred them to the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 - that clearly stipulates that if a replacement for a faulty item is subsequently found to be defective - then I have a right to full refund OR ""a price reduction if you wish to keep the product"" The 'gentleman' from HP said 'Don't care' take it or leave it - and when I said I wanted a new printer or a reduced price and access to the ink service - he closed the case and hung up. It's not over until the fat lady sings and I'm getting really annoyed now.....!!! If you have a choice - Avoid HP - their CRM's are high handed, rude, and are not UK based -  when I declined to accept his omnipotence and asked for escalation, said he was the end of the line...he clearly doesn't know me, p.s. I gave one star because I don't think I can give no stars - caveat emptor

Meanwhile I ordered two other cartridges at the same time from Amazon their expiry date was 2 years. When I called HP to inquire why they were sending me old stock their only reply was I had two choices return the product or take a chance that they will last.so I decided to ask for a return label to return the product since I paid close to $300 for them. I have now been waiting 3 weeks to get a return label to return the product every time I call they tell me they will send it this has been the fourth time I've called. It looks like they do not want me to return this product. Do not order from HP directly all their ink products are out of date.  Order from Amazon.

It would not allow me to restore it meaning I lost an hours worth of hard work. This continued to happen on many occasions. Another issue arose with storage.

I called support and they took me through several steps, none of which were successful in rebooting the computer. Support told me to send in the computer and they would repair it. The expected date of return changesd from 10/31 to Dec 6. I called and complained and the said they would send me a refurbished computer. This was a 2 week old computer that I paid 700 dollars for. Seriously???? After squawking loud enough, they agreed to send me a new computer.  Not the same one, but at least a new one. They continue to put me off, its 11/13/2019 and still no tracking number, still no computer. Do NOT do business with this company.

                My printer died and I bought an HP as a quick replacement. I was happy with it so I kept it. Then it suddenly would not scan to PDF. They replaced the printer 'upgraded' to 5200 series. I had to send the old one back. They did not receive it in time so they made a huge fuss. The printer would not configure to wireless and it took a supervisor on my computer to configure it. Then it was enrolled in instant ink. They sent ink. Then the paper tray malfunctioned and again they replaced the printer. It wouldn't use the instant ink cartridges. They sent me new ones (supposedly non-instant ink). It printed maybe 2 pages and now it says it won't print on instant ink (cartridges are not supposed to be instant ink). Again it won't do wireless and it won't print. I have a business to run and don't have time for this. To add injury to injury they didn't get the old printer back in time and charged me $135 - the agreement for such default was $50.. I had to go to office depot to print my shipping labels and bought an *Epson* printer while I was there. HP is marginal at best.  A large loss of time and money and larger gain of stress. They are never open 4 help and when I tried the automated thing it said the warranty expired Sept 27. I got the printer Oct 5. They are a mess.

                Hello. I use to be a fan of HP but absolutely no more. I purchased an HP 14-ax020wm Stream Notebook 14"" N3060 1.6 Ghz 4GB RAM 32gb eMmc Win10-Purple on October 22, 2019, on-line. It was so slow, I couldn't even go to google.com, facebook.com, etc. I was unable to get to any website fast. Couldn't even upload or download anything within a reasonable amount of time. (I have been in tech for 3 decades)  So I called for support and we did the normal, unsuccessfully. We rebooted the laptop. We disconnected the wifi and re-enabled it. We unplugged the router, waited 2 minutes, and plugged the router back it. All to no avail.   The technician said this is normal. The hard drive could be full. I just purchased the laptop and couldn't access the web to download anything to fill it up.   Needless to say, I told him I want my money back. He said I am out of my warranty date and it couldn't be returned. 16 days after purchasing an HP laptop, I was out of the warranty. I started to flip.    I called On 11/7/2019 and asked to return or exchange the laptop. HP told me the warranty was for 15 days, so they said I was unable to return it. I expressed my dissatisfaction with them, their laptop and their warranty and every policy they have ever written that has gotten them to this point in history.   Therefore, please read this HP Laptops Review, Hewlett-Packard Laptop Review or whatever we can call it so others can find the truth about my experience with HP laptops.

                If I could give my HP laptop zero stars I would do so. Also wish I'd read these reviews first!   I bought my laptop at a cost of £299 just over a month ago from Argos in Edinburgh.  It was fine for about two weeks then began to get slower and slower to do anything and also the screen kept freezing. Tried contacting HP customer support but, apart from having problems understanding what the Chinese lady adviser was saying (it didn't help that she had a cold and sniffed loudly and repeatedly throughout the conversation), got absolutely nowhere. Their technical support team never got back to me either as she said they would. Took it to Argos who said all they could do was to return it to HP for them to have a look at it, but having by now little faith in HP I took it to my usual computer repair man who I've been dealing with for several years now and whose charges are very reasonable.  I was absolutely appalled though when he told me that the problem lay with the hard drive which he said was ""worn out"". I know the laptop was cheap but to be practically useless after only four weeks' usage beggars belief!!  It's now costing me £100 to have the hard drive replaced, which is my only option since as I only have my state pension plus a very small amount of savings I cannot afford the price of another new laptop.  He also told me that although HP used to be a reliable make, their products have gone rapidly downhill in recent years and wouldn't recommend them to anyone, yet stores throughout the UK continue to sell this trash.

                Bought a new laptop for my wife just over a year ago and spilt beer on it, everything worked except the mouse key. Had a quote and told many parts needed to be replaced (although only the key not working) and better to buy a new laptop. So I did. Separately I bought the same type online whilst in Italy last year. After 10 months the mouse key broke (it physically broke and flops from side to side as if a spring has broken). Had it checked and told that the key is integral to the whole board and cannot just be replaced, it would be very expensive and better really to get a new laptop. Final point is that we are back in Italy now for 6 months so not easy to get back to PC World where my wife's 3 month old laptop was bought and her mouse key did exactly the same thing last night. Have just discovered it is impossible to get an email address for HP. The quality of product is terrible and designed in today's disposable society - DON'T REPAIR, JUST BUY NEW!

                Whatever you do, do not buy an HP printer. The worse product experiences of my life. Their customer service do their best to be helpful and kind but the company products themselves simply do not work. I bought the printer a few months ago, in that time the printer was replaced 3 times by the company every time for a different technical glitch. All times I was able to use printer for no more than a couple pages. I enrolled in their instant ink program for which I now have boxes of ink that doesn't work. This means that I spent HOURS on the phone with their customer service, as well as time handling their printers to be shipped back. Factoring in the price of the printer and ink, as well as the time lost dealing with their technical issues, this company has cost me a LOT more than if I had paid an outside printing service. Case manager suppose to call me to handle a full refund. Absolutely not worth it. A real liability.

                Several problems with customer service ending in the refusal to repair my laptop. On October 8, 2019, I sent in my laptop for repair. the only issue it was having was black, grey and white lines on the monitor. I received a call a week later that said I had liquid damage. I had no memory of any liquid being spilled, but my husband had traveled with it a week earlier, so it wasn't in my control the entire time. They wanted to charge $700 to repair it. I called back to decline based on the cost. They then offered a discounted repair price of $400. They left a message saying I had 24 hours to accept the repair. The associate Gabby called me and left a message. I called and emailed back within the 24 hour time frame. However, I didn;t hear back from her until another 3 days when she left me another message saying that they were mailing it back even though she had received my messages. I called back and spoke to another associate. She had told me hours later that they were able to stop it from being mailed out and would repair it. Additionally, she would offer me a further discount of $365 for all of my trouble. I agreed and gave her my credit card info. She didn't ask me for my address and the first charge didn't go through. She apologized and took my address correctly a second time. Afterwards, there was a $365 hold on my bank account. The next day, I received another call from Gabby this time. She said the charge didnt go through and they needed to put another $365 hold on my credit card. I refused. The next day, I recieved a phone call from the other agent who said due to all my problems, they would fix the laptop at no charge. I thanked her and agreed. There was an estimated date of repair as 11.1.19. I called today after no update and was told the laptop was beyond economic repair. The agent Omar told me that the cost to repair the laptop was about half the cost of the laptop (around the original $700). He said they were mailing it back to me. Of course, no one had contacted me to tell me this information. I asked to speak to a supervisor, Hannah. who told me that they don't know the exact cost until the actual repair and several components were damaged and they were mailing it back. They did not offer any information about these components. They did not agree to work with me to repair the laptop and are mailing it back. The extremely long list of errors makes me doubt the veracity of HP. I was told it would be repaired free of charge due to their errors. There was no caveat that it was contingent upon further inspection.

                I have owned an HP OfficeJet 6950 printer for just over two years. The cartridges have worked well and been replaced by post efficiently. I only print fewer that 50 pages per month and I find the annual cost of just under £24 very good.   The downside of HP is their poor explanation of procedures. They recently sent me an email recommending a new website for accessing your Instant Ink account. I found the prominent log-in icon led to an error message. After hours of struggle I contacted online chat and received irrelevant advice.They were obviously not understanding the problem and trying to get rid of me. I then phoned and a very competent person advised me to use the HP Smart app *not the website) and ignore the log-in but just click on ""Get Instant Ink"" instead. She was right.   I cannot really recommend HP these days (after happy memories of Deskjet 500 twenty years ago). Probably best to shop around for a firm with a better reputation and reasonable costs. My old Lexmark printer was very easy to use and caused few problems but the cartridges were expensive.

Each time I check the status, it is stuck on shipping (since 13 October by the way) sending it electronically? Now, I ask all of you, couldn't that be done rather fast nowadays? I know that HP doesn't read any of there reviews, because most of them are negative and if they would have read them, any of them, you'd think by now they would have tried, in the very least to make things better for the consumers that still purchase the HP products. I for one will no be purchasing any other product made by HP and I sure as heck will never purchase a warranty of any sort from these people!

I wouldn't dare donating it to a thrift store and exposing someone else to the harassment of perfectly printing a page and then being blocked because the cartridge failed and needs to be replaced.  I don't know how many times I went through this procedure, wasting countless hours.  Some people on the Internet came up with procedures to block these error messages, including taping a certain cartridge contact.  I don't need that crap from a company that calls itself Hewlett Packard, once a reputable manufacturer.  I am done with them; never ever again!

                Upon registration, the warranty remaining stated '4 months'.  I am supposed to have one year.  I contacted support on the day I purchased my printer.  It also stated something about the original purchase was 2/2/19.  (I didn't know HP sold returned or used printers as new!!)  I sent a copy of my receipt, as requested, showing the purchase date of 10/18/19 and was told the problem would be taken care of in not more than 72 hours.  A couple of days later, I registered for the Instant Ink program.  I was supposed to have a $40 credit to allow 8 months of free ink.  Upon registration I found out I only had two months remaining.  (Second problem on HP.  What a joke of a company.)  The first time I called support, I spent two hours on the problem.  I was not going to do this again.  I simply returned the printer.  This was my first and LAST HP purchase.  Burn me once, shame on you.  Burn me twice, shame on me.  It appears you burned me twice.  I will never give HP another chance to burn me again.

                HP are forcing people to use only their mega-expensive original inks! HP pushed an update to printers on the internet (and most of us have our printer online there days) - blocking people from using non-original cartridges. How greedy does a company need to be, to force people to use their extremely expensive inks? I get that you don't want printers with a warranty using inferior ink, but ultimately it's my printer and I should be free to use the inks I choose. I won't even consider paying the £90 (that's more than the printer cost!) for ink - my 18 month old printer is being thrown out and replaced with a product that is cheaper to feed.

                Bought a HP OfficeJet 5220 All-in-One Printer/Scanner. Straight out of the box with the setup cartridges that came with it and you have to use to set up the printer, It did not work. Kept telling me to use other cartridges. I called customer services only to have them try to tell me it was a used printer when I literally just opened the box and took the printer and the cartridges out of it's original packing. I told them as such and they began troubleshooting, which just involved me taking the cartridges in and out which I had already tried. He said they were sending me new cartridges as I am under warranty. The guy on the phone guessed my last name when I said it instead of just asking what it was and sent UPS to my building for a package to Daniel Flemo which is not my name. UPS obviously could not find me in the directory (as my name is Danielle Palermo and nowhere close to Flemo) and did not deliver the package. When I called to figure out what was going on, I was told to call UPS myself to figure it out. I told them to do it themselves as I was not the one who sent out the package to begin with, I didn't even have the tracking number. They said they fixed it, which they did not as on Monday, I got an email saying Daniel Flemo could not be delivered a package (which they sent to my email which is my god damn name). I called UPS myself and cleared it up, I am still unable to print and have not received the cartridges. It should not be this difficult to get a printer working. The support workers barely do their job and the products don't work out of the box apparently. I basically had to complain till they did their job, which they still could not accomplish. If you want things done, do it yourself, cause HP customer service sure isn't going to do it for you.

                I have had three HP laptops. The first two lasted less than 24 months so I decided to go with the expensive high-end Spectre model. Within the first year, it had to be sent to HP for power issues. Then warranty ran out, the issue came back and now they are charging me almost 500 to fix it. The issue is a design error (charger port) that was later corrected on future models. No responsibility for quality. The laptop is less than 24 months old and worthless. DONE with this brand.

It hangs up multiple times but i kept calling anyway and it finally went through. The first person hung up on me so I had to call 12x again just to get through. Finally reached someone who i thought was really helpful but the problem wasn't resolved. He refused to replace my printer even though it's under warranty. He wants me to go waste more money on ink and try to print again even though we've spent so much money on ink already and IT'S NOT PRINTING!!! He was suppose to be getting a supervisor on the phone, but instead he hung up on me AGAIN! WORST COMPANY EVER. I've wasted so much money. Our doctor's office hasn't been able to print for 2 weeks now and were just getting the run around. DO NOT CHOOSE HP.

                Worst experience ever! I bought a HP pavilion x360 convertible laptop in August from India. One of the reasons I selected HP is it's international warranty since I moved to Dublin, Ireland after buying it. In less than 2 months the laptop suddenly died and stopped responding. customer care representatives said that it will take upto a month to get it fixed after it reaches them. Refused to provide any sort of replacement (permanent/ temporary) during that period. Then it took them a whole week just to get it picked up (had to stay home till then) After following up aggressively I was promised that the laptop will reach me by 15th Oct. Then today, again they pushed the date to 18th Oct. I am not sure if it's the final one. Better to get MacBook instead. This model was not very cheap either! Also, when I asked for the channel to escalate, HP watsapp chat support executive said there is no way to do so! Highly inconvenient and worst experience I ever had.

                Owned a new HP Printer with the instant ink deal for exactly two hours . The online automated help could not help. I could not connect to the internet therefore could not proceed with the setup instructions. The automated help could not help with this scenario . I had no option  other than to put everything back in the box and send it back , I am 53 years old ,maybe to old for HP products .

                If I could give no stars!! Shockingly bad service! I had to cancel my HP instant ink service because I've moved country and they do not provide these services here, so I went out and bought brand new HP cartridges, got home, put them in, and it says incompatible. I went on to HP support for this country and got put through to an English speaking team who told me that because I was contacting them on a Saturday they would have to contact me back on Monday as my problem is printer related. Monday by 5pm nobody had contacted me so I replied to the same chat asking for help again and they asked me to allow them a few minutes to read previous messages. I still heard nothing back on Monday, so Tuesday I contacted again and they told me that the printer team have logged out and they will contact me today. At 9:13 this morning they messaged me back finally and because I didn't reply for half an hour they had the cheek to chase me up! When I replied to say I still needed help they told me that I have been misrouted to the incorrect support team and told me to message a different number. So I messaged the other team who then replied to my message in a different language and then told me that if I wanted to speak to an English service team to contact a different number, the number they gave me was to the previous team that told me to contact them! So when I went to message them again they told me that they were the wrong team and disconnected the chat! I've since gone online to see if I can get help from the UK site through a VPN service and am still being passed around to different teams!! The problem is still not resolved and am starting to think that it won't be! I've had enough of all this and am now thinking I might buy a new printer that isn't HP as the service is so awful and am not sure what else to do!!!!

                Have spent 3 hours and still have not reached anyone who understands English. Hp puts customer service out of the country so they can get away with cheap wages. I have a simple question. I cannot get into windows because it no longer recognizes my password. When I buy my next tablet or laptop it will not be a HP. Worst tech support/customer service!!!!!!!!!!

                Bought New HP Deskjet 2622 Month ago. Worked OK for 6 Pages. Has Since Failed To PRINT. Signed up to Their New £1.99 Monthly Replacement Cartridge Deal Which Is Not Much Good if The Printer Fails to Print. From What I Gather From Reading Their Customer Reviews.Could Be Tricky Cancelling Monthly Deal? Suggest Future Customers Be Wary of Signing Up ,to What Initially Sounded, a Great Deal.

To make it short they waited until I was out of warranty called back they told me If I paid they could look at it.  All after dealing with a bad customer service, that deny me the option of talking to a supervisor.

                Disgusting Customer Service!  I ordered a laptop with a delivery estimate of 48 hours, that changed to 5-10 working days on order completion. I received an email saying the product would be with me on the 8th October. Then when I checked the website the estimated deliver was changed to the 24th October? On the 7th October I called HP only to find that the 24th is another estimate and I may not receive the product for months as they cannot guarantee delivery? They took full payment on the date I ordered, and I think it is disgusting that they are still advertising a time of 5-10 days on the product I ordered, when they have none in stock and admitted they do not know when they will be back in stock? The person I spoke to sounded monotone and did not care a hoot about the delay, they offered to cancel the order, and that was their solution. Disgraceful way to run a business - avoid!

                I bought a top of the line HP ENVY just over a year ago. I only used it for work. Today, I opened the top and the screen completely separated from the backing and a hinge completely broke. It seemed perfectly fine yesterday. I contacted HP and they said the warranty was expired and it would be $400 to repair. The laptop broke by OPENING it up. You're supposed to open it to use it (duh). And by opening it up, it broke after just over a year? Worthless garbage. Get something more durable.

                I wish i could give them zero stars. Their customer services is beyond a joke. They hide behind the fact that you can not call them directly and when you call the only number they give you, the persons says that they will email the right department and ask them to call you back, which they do not. I am disgusted with the time it is taking to sort this issue and with the far below sub standard service that this company provide. I tried using the WhatsApp option and they took 30 minutes between messages. I have purchased many HP products for myself and my company and i can honestly say that they will never get another penny from me and i will gladly share my experience with everyone from friends, colleagues and even clients. My laptop was a top end Spectre 360 and it has failed 3 times in 10 months, causing much stress. They never seem to appreciate that when you have travel visas and important information needed to other companies projects and activities, the loss of access to this data can have huge repercussions. I am utterly disgusted by this company.

                I bought HP Envy X360 two weeks back from their online sales here in Australia; now the display/screen turns dark and flickers intermittently when the power cord is disconnected from the laptop, when I called for the support services, India based technical representative said that, they cannot send a technician over for a repair and hence need to spend a whole day waiting for a courier to show up and pick up this piece of junk (no, they will not let me drop this junk to the nearby post office at my convenience, rather they want me to take a whole day off to wait for the courier guy to arrive), the repair service may require another 7/8 days for repair and yet another 2/4 days for delivery. What could be worse than this? I will be without a laptop for the next 11 days. I'm really missing the touch of quality here, which I received from Dell Australia. I bought a dell laptop overseas and when I came here in Australia, it stopped working due to a major hardware issue, I called Dell and within 10 minutes of my call, they created a service order number and sent the repair guy the very next day. I would not recommend anyone to buy HP products anymore. As I'm still under the cooling-off/chance of mind time frame, I will try to get a full refund back, if not possible, I shall escalate this issue with the NSW fair trading which checks on the unscrupulous traders.  I have all the proofs (invoices, email history) if anyone wants to see. Please make sure that no-one buys HP products anymore unless they don't care what they are buying

                Do not buy their 'care pack'. The advertising is fraudulent, misleading, dishonest etc.... It specifically states that 'accidental damage' and 'spillages' are covered. They still refuse to do any repairs and they lie repeatedly in their reasons for refusal, changing to a new excuse after each reason is proven invalid.

                Most appalling customer service system I have yet to come across. If I could give it 0 stars I would but had to select at least 1 to leave a review.   Bought laptop off them which was dysfunctional and had to be returned. Thought it was just bad luck so paid extra £200 to have better model so £500 in total for basic model but it still crashes regularly but now is too late to return so am stuck with it as alternative is me trying to get through to customer service....which is what has prompted this review.  Bought printer that was peer reviewed and had excellent feedback. My experience was terrible though, would not install fully and would not work properly even once HP staff had taken over by remote assistance.  Trying to get to that point took two days though. First time waiting over 2.5 hours on their 'quick' What's App contact but getting no response at all. Simultaneously phoned them and got through quicker there, just over 40 mins, to be told it sounded like a driver error and then have my call cut off. Immediately rung back but automated message telling me they were now closed for day so I had clearly been cut off deliberately.  Following day waited hours again, What's App, phone, and Facebook messenger. Operative I eventually spoke to was as helpful as they could be but wait was appallingly slow.  Requested postal or email address for complaints, no such thing. Gave me a phone number instead. I just laughed! Exactly why they get away with reviews not truly representing how poor their service is as it's clearly made deliberately difficult to make a complaint. Will never buy a product of theirs again and have advised everyone I know to do the same.

This company is totally SCAM, complained about their unprofessional services to the MD of the company, One month and so now, until to date NO reply at all from the MD, who represents in the UK. Please be aware, as their senior and junior officers are DODGY. They don't have any such after-sales services with their company. This company has a greedy ideology, as all their senior officers are from the USA, so they don't care, their faith is money. I am repenting now to have their bloody DODGY computer company, as this company's reputation is gone now. They lost their credibility in the UK market and abroad. No one prefers their products, you will see soon,Their days are numbered now after lots and lots of unresolved complaints from the consumers. I bought the 3 YEAR CARE PACK PICKUP &amp; RETURN SERVICE and their unprofessional staff provided me wrong product, I paid the full amount of £60.00, when complained, their complaints team asked me to repurchase another Care Pack, as they don't refund the money back. This is how they deal with their customers. This GREEDY AND DODGY HP Company is totally BOGUS. Don't trust to any of the HP agents, as they are same and don't expect any services from this DISCRIMINATED COMPANY IN THE UK. Most of the UK and abroad people don't wont to work this dodgy company, as they think that there are in USA and can do, whatever they want, but UK rules and regulations are different than USA. BE AWARE WITH THIS GREEDY Company. Their MD is also aggressive and rude. Don't think that the MD of this dodgy company will help you. You are wrong. So, please stay away from this company and better to have other reliable brands of Computers, Laptops and accessories. Don't be trapped with their SWEET TONGUE conversation, as I have been trapped.

                What a rubbish company. The entire process post-sale is a nightmare. Ordered a printer and cartridges directly from their website as they suppose to deliver with 48 hours the latest.  64 Hours later, they never sent me an email or Text to inform when my printer is coming &amp; when I called them to ask where my order is they didn't have a clue why it hasn't left the Depot. Upon being promised that a solution will be found, I was never contacted &amp; when I tried to call them back AGAIN, there was only an automated voice system....  Really HP?! Really?! No surprise why your Share of market is going from bad to worse. You need to be mindful that selling a product is consisted of the entire 360 process: Sale - Aftersales service - delivery to customer.  I'm giving them another 12 hours and i'm cancelling my order.

                If I could rate this as a 0 I would!!!!!! I called because my printer randomly stopped printing. I was told it was due to the inside hardware, but since my warranty expired in July they wouldn’t be able to help me. When I told them that was not going to be acceptable they told me I could upgrade the printer for $80.....this entire company is a scam. “Supervisor” Carl blamed me for not extending the warranty and blamed this on the fact I bought it on Amazon and not directly from HP. “There’s nothing I can do for you” When I asked to be transferred to his supervisor he said he’s is a supervisor and it is sufficient enough, but didn’t like when I said to have the supervisor who makes more than him handle this since he is incompetent and will not do anything more than a salesman pitch he brought up I can only buy a new product for $80. They have TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS &amp; their products are trash.    “Supervisor” Carl, employee ID: P4781592 needs to either get fired or grow thick skin.

                Terrible experience!!! Don't buy HP!!!   I bought HP Spectre X360 in July 2019.  It works for a month.  Then USB-C stop working.   When you pick up a phone or use chat, you are never able to talk to a live person.   HP only has one authorized service center, Micro Center, in Tustin CA in great LA area (all others listed in HP's website are phony).  So I brought my computer to Micro Center.  It took them two weeks to fix the problem because HP was not responsive in shipping the replacement part of the board for USB-C.  Now the board got replaced and USB-C ports work.  But the HDMI and printer functions do not work.  It was working fine for a month before.  New problems keep coming up and I got no HP person to give me help.  It is a terrible experience.

Of course their OEM ones are exorbitantly priced. Simple solution ditch HP and buy EPSON. Love that they have the refillable tanks and the ink lasts a long, long time unlike HP.

                Purchased the HP Deskjet 2630 All-In-One Printer 18 months ago for regular household use.  I was sceptical about the InstaInk option but found it easy to set up and now don't know how I'd manage without it.  The printer itself is wireless and the installation instructions are very easy to follow.  Even if you don't want InstaInk indefinitely, you may as well choose the InstaInk option initially and benefit from the 3-month free trial.  Go to 123.hp.com Follow the set up instructions for your printer.  On the recommendation of other purchasers, I chose the 300 page option for the free 3 month trial to get the maximum benefits from the free offer. (Edit: There's now an option for 500 free pages!!)  On the final page before subscription, there was a ""Special Offers (Optional)"" box in which I entered:  FREEINK for an additional 1 month free and lN7PW (the first letter is a lower case L) for an further 1 month free.  It didn't appear as if the codes had worked until I looked in the bottom right hand corner of the pop up window to see a list of the free months: 3 months free trial FREEINK 1 month free lN7PW 1 month free  Five free months of ink (1500 pages printed colour pages) and an excellent printer for less than two XL cartridges with my old HP printer.  Having used it for 18 months now and enjoyed the hassle-free delivery of cartridges ready for when I need them, I can highly recommend this printer and the InstantInk option.

                Money hungry , scammin , Rip off you name it . This company is trash! I did a factory reset on my computer there was never a note or pop up that says I need to know or rememeber or even take my password off the computer before resetting now I can’t get back into my computer when I’ve had same username and log in for 3 years since I purchased the laptop and being that I cannot sign into my computer ( no password hint , security questions or anything ) I have to pay 50 dollars to have an “ expert “ unlock my computer ( apple would never !! ) I’m so upset I could sue the company !! Not to mention I brought a small tablet from hp right before I brought the laptop and the tablet literally died on me after 2 weeks !! The tablet barely worked I should’ve known how trash they are from that experience

                Please make a copy of what you are buying from HP official site before you make any purchase! The laptop that I ordered was not what I received, and It was  an agonizing experience for me, Lots of runaround and at the end of the day It was over 30 days and the prices have gone up da! da! da!........ I was worn out and disgusted!  The 17 inch laptop was ordered on July 10th.  it is NOT a TOUCH SCREEN HP! FRAUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Helene.

                my laptop has been sent back 3 times,  still without it right now. When it come bacck from the first repair there were still the same issues and some new ones, blown speakers !!!  second time it went back  was to get these fixed!  3rd time was arranged the day i got my machine back as it now has dents, lump and casing wasnt on properly, the laptop woudlnt sit flat on a surface, abbsoutely terrible.  And they kept telling me i have the premium line spectre model.   Im so disapointed with this machine, even more because its less than a year old.  Ive had a really bad experience with the company, and so far they have offfered me a list to orrder a mouse or bag,  no thanks, i need my laptop, why cant they just replace it!  They have made it worse over time!

                I have an hp. envy 360 laptop. Under a year old. It crashed and they sent it back with a new hard drive. It worked for a few weeks and it just crashed again. I could not get them to honor their warranty and replace it again. I will forever boycott hp.

                Absolutely impossible to get a hold of someone at HP. They are a huge scam. I have purchased a HP printer only for their software to prevent me from ever printing in colour. I have tried all the solutions online and none work. Attempting to claim a refund under sales of good act (product not as described/fit for purpose) if this isn't resolved. I've been having this issue for months now and I'm literally tearing out my hair.

                Your rating is well deserved!!! I bought a HP Omen gaming laptop back in oct last year, by the time it became clear that this laptop is total crap. the thermal paste on the cpu and videocard was gone in only 6m onths of use. and the laptop started thermal throtling. 3 months down the line (9 months after the purchase) there was another problem which seems to be a problem with the battery, i sent the laptop to HP and they refused to service it under warranty. Everyone should know how crap HP service and built quality is!!!!  I WILL NEVER BUY HP AGAIN, ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE BRAND IS MUCH BETTER THAN HP!!!

                Most ripoff company I have EVER had the pain-FULL experience of having to deal with.You buy a printer for 100.00 sometimes less, then the ink last not even a month.  Ink cost $30.00 to $50.00.  So $50.00 per month to be able to print.  CRAP on HP Never will I EVER buy anything with HP name on it.  Ha! I tried to see what the cost of the ink is if I joined their club nope, not happening, sing up first, give them your credit card number, then and only then will you find out the cost, oh and of course you are in their 'club"" not for me!!!   I will use this printer with what ever ink I can find to work then I will buy a nice printer WITHOUT HP name on it!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!! No HP anything, bunch of RIP-OFFS

                We recently purchased from HP a business laptop on sale for $1300. It would always dim when the power cord was disconnected. I could not find where to stop this, and the screen was only 200 nits, so the dimming hurt my older eyes.  HP business support has very competent people––but their training is pretty bad.  Finally, a rep familiar with the problem simply downloaded the AMD graphics application which allowed this to be easily adjusted. Before that I went through 6 *long* phone calls, all of which were with agents who felt my system software was corrupted because the setting to adjust this was present in their older version of Windows 10 and not in mine. Turns out that is a known issue. Windows removed access to this setting in newer versions, but these guys did not know that.  They had me update to the very latest Windows, run a core level hardware test that took hours, and even re-image my computer.   Then they forced me to send the unit to their repair center, as the on-site repair support I purchased could not do any troubleshooting. I instructed them on the return repair sheet to carefully read all the case notes available to them.   The computer came back with the same problem, and their repair notes clearly showed that they never bothered to even look at the case notes. They just did the same thing I had already done and got the same results, not bothering to even acknowledge the problem they were supposed to fix.  But it gets much worse…….  We then purchased a printer that turned out to be defective. The quality of printer support is clearly much lower, but after over two hours the agent agreed to send us a replacement refurbished upgraded printer. It arrived and easily set up and worked. I sent the defective unit back as instructed within three business days, using the label supplied by HP.   Ten days later we get an email saying they have not received the printer and we will be charged for it if it is not shipped immediately. I kept the tracking number which provided proof of delivery a full three business days before the threatening email was sent.  I was unable to contact any type of support using the data for the replacement printer. Fortunately, we had the prior printer’s data, and after tons of wasted time, I get through to a support person who kept repeating that the printer had not been received after I told her five times that the UPS site provided proof of delivery to her warehouse. When I finally asked for a supervisor she apologized and said she would correct the problem and I could ignore the email. She also agreed to register the replacement printer, as that process would not work either.  The next day I confirmed that she simply fed me falsehoods to get rid of me. Another call to support resulted in a repeat of the prior call, with me giving details of the delivery and the agent saying it had not been received. Finally, he admitted that he had no way of checking the return tracking number for this case and that all he could do was send an email to the repair center with my complaint and supposedly including the tracking number I provided him.  This hardly left me feeling confident, so I posted about the problem on the HP forum. I was then contacted by a social media HP rep who emailed the complaint to the repair center. Late on the next business day, he told me the center acknowledged receiving the printer. Today, a day after that, we have still not received a confirmation from HP support.  I have left out other problems with HP support as this is already too long. But without the details, this condemnation would only be a subjective opinion.

                I brought a laptop from currys, it more expensive than the first one I was looking at but it was supposed to be the best model, well it was total rubbish  and when I tried to return it I got fobbed off so it went in the cupboard to collect dust, just got it back out and yes still slow unresponsive, crashes and error after error and does not respond when you click on something but then 5mins later it wakes up so not ever but a hp laptop even if the specs are double that of another it is possibly the worst computer I have ever owned it has not worked since it came out the box

                My experience of HP printing products after many years and several printers. I have worked all my life in IT technical service and support dealing directly with customers. These products from HP are designed to make the company as much money as possible without making it too obvious they are ripping people off. When a printer generates a error message the diagnostic tests should point clearly to where the fault is. Repeatedly telling customers to disconnect wait for 15 minutes and then reconnect to solve problems is not going to fix a underling problem. Ignoring customers stating they have already done this just frustrates them further. Here is a very common senario that is repeated in HP help steps and forum suggestions.......       ‎09-16-2016 06:35 PM  Product: HP Photosmart D5160 Operating System: Mac OS X 10.7 Lion This household has two HP printers -- a Photosmart D5160 and Officejet Pro 8610. Actually, my wife is now on her fourth HP printer -- the Officejet Pro -- because of problems with three previous HP printers that could not be resolved and had to be replaced.  Now, I'm having trouble my HP Photosmart D5160. In short, it won't print. I get numerous kinds of errors on the print utility, ranging from ""Cover is Open"" to ""Carriage is Stalled"" to ""Printer not Connected"", etc. All within minutes of one another. I do all the recommended trouble-shooting but nothing resolves the issue. When I contacted HP Support, I was told that my printer is no longer being serviced by HP. So, once again, this household is without one of its printers.  We do NOT use these printers that frequently. Maybe once or twice a week at most, so there is no 'wear &amp; tear' factor here. I'm not sure what to do. I'm ready to throw both of these printers into the garbage and go someplace else for a printer.

                Expensive products that become obsolete after a few short years so when you spend hundreds of dollars on them and the drivers stop properly installing customer support will tell you it's a hardware issue and you must upgrade- spend a few hundred more- on a newer product. Ink for printers are ridiculously priced and if you get the generic that is more reasonable priced they'll work a few times and then about halfway through the cartridges have an error message that is telling you there is a problem with your ink. Money hungry company that cares little about their consumers. Call support and they try to charge you twenty dollars for troubleshooting. Disgusting way of treating people. This is a perfect example of corporate america shitting the bed.

At 8:08pm I received an email saying that  my order was shipped. It was late I called next day in the morning and they did not stopped/ cancel the shipping when It was showing that the item was still at there facility only a label has been  Create it.

                Make no mistake, this is a great coffee maker. The ability of choose your own settings, flow rate, bloom time, water temp, all make for a great cup of coffee. But for $300, I would think they've worked out the mechanical kinks. We've already sent our thermal brew pot back once, because of coffee leaking down the machine and pooling on the counter. The new one has a similar problem, and coffee pools under the pot. We are constantly mopping up drips and trails of coffee. Love the brew, not thrilled with the machine.

                Please be wary if you choose this brand, I had a Breville espresso machine that short circuited, it was two and a half years old and well maintained. I rang Breville who organised for me to take the machine to a nearby repairer. The repairer soon contacted me to tell me that there was a leaky seal and that it was a manufacturing fault rather than a ware and tear issue.  The cost to repair would be $320.<br/>This would turn out to be the second repair to this machine, the first repair cost me $164. I rang Breville to see if there was any chance they would replace the machine or at least cover the cost of the repair especially considering the machine history. I was told the issue would be investigated and I would receive a phone call back in a day or two. After eight days and no phone call, I rang them back. Clearly the issue had not been investigated so the lady that took my call promised me she would follow this up and ring me back the following morning. <br/>To her credit, she rang back and told me that as the machine 12 month warranty had run out it was a ware and tear issue (not what I was told by the repairer) and that none of the cost would be worn by breville, nor would I receive a replacement machine, in other words, as soon as the warranty had run out, they didn't want to know about it! I nearly fell over!!  <br/>Being a business owner myself this is a classic case of poor customer service, I have been a loyal brand (Breville) consumer for a number of years but poor service is something I simply will not tolerate.<br/>Had Breville agreed to help me this review would be favourable rather than negative! I remain thoroughly disappointed rather than angry.<br/>Needless to say, I will not be buying this brand again.......

                Breville will not sell internal parts at all. They will only accept the entire unit back for servicing at a ridiculously high flat rate of &gt;50% of  new unit price.<br/>Shame on them for contributing to landfill junk.

                Do not waste your money! I purchased the Breville milk frother. The first time I used the product it surpassed all expectations, producing an abundant froth more like whipped cream. I was impressed. After 2 months, and having used the milk frother less than 15 times, it stopped working. I had a very expensive appliance to warm milk. I called customer support and was instructed where to return my frother. I received the replacement quickly. I tried it immediately with great results, but alas, after about 2 months, the frother once again produces only warm milk!

                Bought a breville cafe milk frother in late 2017 from David’s tea for a Christmas gift for myself, because why not treat myself? The insurance cheque had just cleared after the beast (total loss). Anyway, the milk frother stopped working today so I called breville expecting some reasonable troubleshooting tips or perhaps them to offer 30-40% off a new machine since this one was in pristine condition externally but had shhht the bed. Instead, the lady on the phone tells me if I don’t have the receipt there is nothing further they can do. I can pay 99$ for a repair—but that doesn’t give any warranty. It’s on sale at the bay for 129$ with shipping right now. She said based on my machines serial number I could have owned it since 2011. That’s insane. It was likely manufactured then, and in a warehouse, then sitting in a store for a while before I bought it. I lost everything in a fire that devastated my community. Does this “lady” really think I escaped with a milk frother and this is some conspiracy? What is she smoking?!?! I have a variable temperature breville kettle, and a handheld mixer and they’re both breville products. I’ll be selling this garbage and buying smeg, kitchen aid or something else. Never supporting this company again. Total disgust in the workmanship of this product and the employees.

                My experience with support was terrific.  I have had a Breville Oracle touch espresso machine for over a year.  Tried to clean the grinder and it was jammed.  I called customer support.  The wait time was said to be long, but they allowed me to leave my number.  Got a return call within 5 minutes, and the woman on the other end was both polite, professional and talked me through the issue within minutes.  She waited on line to be certain the issue was totally resolved.

                Do not buy a Breville food processor. I have the Sous Chef 12. Poor documentation and help online. This unit has a cord of about 12"" long and they say not to use an extension cord. ??? Completely stupid, no other word applies. I've submitted an online email request for help/suppot. If I change my mind about their integrity, I'll let you know.

                I purchased a Breville BES920XL espresso maker.   The first unit malfunctioned.   It was sent in for repairs.   It then malfunctioned again.  It was sent in for repair.   It malfunctioned again<br/>  It was then replaced with a new unit.   The new unit malfunctioned.   It  was sent in for repair and shipped back to ne on January 31, 2019.  It has now malfunctioned again.   This time I'm told the unit is off warranty,  therefore I will need to pay over $300.00 for the repair, although I have had the unit back only a year.   This espresso machine does make great coffee and has many nice features but the Breville product reliability is terrible.  My problems have all been software related.  The company needs to address this issue.

                So I bought the $2,500 Oracle coffee machine in Sept 2019, top of the line item.<br/>I read the water filter reviews and was not happy so I called Breville and they assured me that this issue was resolved and it was a 1 time matter,<br/>Fast foward to beginning of Dec and time for a new water filter.  It is now Jan. 2nd and still no filters!.  That was the short story, it was promised weeks ago, then was told out of stock.<br/>When I complained to supervisor and said I am not going through this every time for new filters; that I want to return it, they said out of warrantty!  I said but you lied about the issue and they just said sorry.<br/>So NO DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM AT ALL!!

                A toaster has only one purpose - to toast bread.  I am sorry I wasted my money on the Breville (the bit More) 2-slice toaster.  One has to turn it almost to it's highest setting to get a good browning.  To make matters worse, it hardly toasts the second side of the same slice!  This is not a cheap toaster, it's performance is lousy.  I highly recommend NOT buying it.

                I sent in my Breville juicer for repairs on 3 November. Finally, after much fighting and people not getting back to me, I found out on 19 December that there is a spare part that needs to come from Australia but no one knows when I can get my machine back, despite multiple promises about how the process would work. In fact, I was supposed to get my machine back last week. Suddenly I find out this new information that no one told me for weeks.<br/><br/>This is the first Breville product I owned, and I was happy with it and had a positive view of Breville. That started to change when I was looking at buying their Peel and Dice food processor and sent an e-mail asking about the myriad problems I had read about, the reply to which was essentially ""If it doesn't make customers happy, it's okay because we like it"". Now this experience with getting my only Breville product repaired has sealed the deal. I will not touch another Breville product again and I will also stay away from all of the companies in the Foschini Group, including the @Home stores, as they are part of this very negative experience.

While the offer the part on their website at the cost of $2.99 (which is fine) - I had guests coming into town for the holidays and couldn't wait that long.<br/><br/>So for a high-end machine and (in theory) company:<br/>- They need to go the extra mile in customer service (also not take 6.5hrs to call people back)<br/>- They need to make plastics that aren't so fragile that they break so soon and so easily.<br/>- They need to offer expedited shipping options to their customers (that's eCommerce 101 stuff).

                Breville support is non existent.  We bought the barista express and the pressure gauge will not increase. My husband has tried for a week to get in touch.  The support number says you can elect to get a call back, but it does not provide a means to indicate you want a call back. Then it tells you there are a high volume of calls and just hangs up on you.   My husband is returning the machine today.

                Freaking aweful service! I just purchased this after black friday. Straight out of the box the pressure pin will not even climb. It is suppose to at least reach the center and it doesnt do anything. The crema is not even coming out. Called the support like and it actually tells me they are experiencing higher then normal call times and tells me to call back another time then hangs up the phone on me. This is day 2 of trying to contact them. Guess who is returning this and going with a different company, me. I do not have time to waste on a crap company like this. I will take my $500 somewhere else.

This is day 2 of trying to contact them. Guess who is returning this and going with a different company, me. I do not have time to waste on a crap company like this. I will take my $500 somewhere else.

                Contacting any type of Breville  support is a nightmare!!! I am in Canada and the support center is in Quebec and if Breville cares about their image they should change service providers. Where are these people, In the North Pole or perhaps the Moon? I made an experiment on waiting for someone to pick the phone call, by the way there is no other way for contact, for 2.5 hours until my phone battery died with no success :) Do not ever consider the option of providing your phone number so they supposedly keep your place on the line. Ha, what a joke, I did it twice and was sent in the twilight zone indefinitely. The joke is on us however, the customers. I only need a replacement for my double shot pressurized basket for my brand new Breville Barista Pro where it just happened the included one is clogged and not working at all. I am ready to buy myself a new one but can't find it anywhere. I pray I do not need them for anything in the future and so much in the beginning with my Breville's family membership I already doubt my next purchase will have that same logo on it. Sooooo Sad..

                I sincerely don't know what what these people are actually complianing about. While on hold to get my new Breville espresso cappuccino machine figure it out I read all these horrible reviews on the customer service provided by this company. This is absolutely NOT true. My waiting time was 50 minutes and the customer service that I received from the lady that the people are complaining about was absolutely outstanding. She was able to help me for like half an hour and remained very polite and professional through the whole process while guiding me to correct my machine. I am sincerely so grateful and happy that this lady helped me solve my issue as the cappuccino espresso machine that I was fixing, I had bought in for a friend. This review is coming right from the heart and is exactly my experience. Don't believe everything you read

                Had a toaster 7 months before it started tripping the electric last week. Seems to be a common fault, which they obviously know about. Tried writing a 1 star review, but they won’t publish it. How is that fair to customers? Don’t waste your money!

                Breville customer service very very bad. The lady answering  my call not very nice in giving answers or listening to a customer and she promised to send me an email with an offering price which is not the best deal about a dicing kit.She never sent the email.Besides, I called since I bought the Breville 16 cup peel and dice food processor; the box displays the different dicing kit but it is not part of the contents in the box but instead I found a piece of paper saying I can get a free dicing kit, limited time and first register the product.I registered the food processor I bought and I was expecting to get instructions to get this free dicing kit, but nothing happened. That was my reason I called to customer service. The lady said it is an old offer and they do not offer it anymore.I try to explain if something is displayed outside of the box ,customers expect to see those contents inside of the box and because this was not the situation...for sure this is a false display making customers believe they are paying for something that it really doesn’t come in the box...I am very disappointed knowing customer service is the worst experience I have faced. When I called they never answered the phone and even if you send a case...event though it mentions you will get an answer soon...that never happened to me.<br/> I am very disappointed Breville does  not have a good customer service and it seems they do not care about customers.Because of this I feel next time I will not buy any other product from them...unless they make sure customer service can be a good support to all it’s clients.

                My Boss Breville blender was not working properly, it got unbearably noisy. I contacted Breville through Facebook and they were fantastic about replacing it with the new model of a more expensive blender for free.  I was very impressed with the service.

                I don't have a Breville Barista Express, but I wanted to buy one until I could not even reach then after spending a whole morning waiting to be contacted by them.  What the h***.  How do they stay in business?  I wanted to ask them about possibly buying an extended warranty, but will now look for another brand. Wow is all I can say and so disrespectful to customers. Very disappointed because the unit was highly recommended.

                Terrible Terrible Terrible!<br/><br/>You will wait on the phone for 2+ hours.<br/><br/>Also, after typing your number into the phone, NO one calls.<br/><br/>This review is based on every single encounter I have had with this company (12+ encounters)<br/><br/>Unreal, the wait time to speak to anyone on ANY day, ANY time is always 2+ hours. <br/><br/>Pathetic at best...

                Worst possible customer service.  They supposedly will call you back when you type in your telephone number but on now FOUR separate occasions they have not returned the call.  I had to return a spendy product (combo grinder and coffee maker) and when I inquired into the status the cookie-cutter response was ""your order is being carefully packed.""  Awful company.  Plus, the product worked fine for a month then stopped working at least twice a week -- I had to manually go in and chip away coffee build-up.  Understandable to do it every few months or so, but twice a year?  Save yourself the grief and don't buy from this company

                No customer support! Tried to refund a toaster that broke a few weeks after purchase. Cannot return to Williams Sonoma. No one answers Customer Support and responses take 2-3 days if at all. Sent the wrong toaster in exchange which is the size of a convention oven. Do not purchase Breville products at Williams Sonoma and avoid Customer Support. Avoid their products.

                Bought a new espresso machine, Barista Express. The machine was unusable out of the box as it was unable to produce the pressure to pull a decent shot. Contacted Breville right away and was told that ""the pressure doesn't simply stop working..."" and that the issues must be either old coffee beans or my inability to grind the coffee correctly. I was sent a youtube link to perform a pressure test, which I did, and which the machine failed. I let Breville know the outcome of the pressure test, twice, and sent a video demonstrating the test and its results. I requested instructions on how to return/exchange the machine and have never heard from this company again...absolutely appalling! In the meantime I also discovered that after filling the water tank, the water somehow leaks into the tray...I had filled the tank to prime the machine and after a while realized that the water was getting lower in the tank without having used the machine...I don't even know how that is possible. I let Breville know that as well and still, no answer...I'll do everything I can to never buy another Breville product!

                I bought a breville milk cafe april 10 2019 and it worked great for about 3 months. I even posted on amazon how great it was. Then it stopped frothing in the way it was supposed to. I called breville and their service was great and sent me a new one. Well it worked great for a month. Now its back to doing the same thing it did when i returned it. So for the price 172$ its not worth it.really am disappointed because when it worked it was yielding great froth. Jane doiron from canada

                Beware of using the Breville Pizzaiola Oven on quartz countertops. <br/><br/>I learned the hard way, and now my gorgeous, pristine white counter has an 8"" crack. The oven operates at a very high heat. No indication in the manual that this could be an issue. First time I ran it, I heard a very loud crack, and thought the stone broke. But once it cooled down and I check, the stone was fine and I was perplexed. I used it again on New Years Eve, and when I went to clean up I found the crack right in front of the oven. It appears the heat that emanates when the door is opened caused the crack and the first time, it began underneath and then surfaced upon the second use. <br/><br/>I contacted Breville and while they are very nice, they refused to acknowledge this could be an issue. I did research after the fact, and it seems quartz can withstand heat of up to 150°F. While I have always loved Breville products, this lack of concern for their customers is very disappointing.<br/><br/> I love the oven and have purchased some heat resistant mats to set it upon, which I told Breville they should ship with the oven. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I see that crack, and makes me feel very bad about the Breville organization.

                Breville Lift and Look toaster. Buyer Beware. This toaster looks great. After researching I thought I purchased a top quality product. However, it has NOT worked properly since the day it arrived. It malfunctions constantly where it locks so you’re unable to insert a piece of bread or bagel. You then hear a clicking noise and subsequently all the buttons are lite and they begin blinking. After pulling the cord from the electrical socket and letting it sit for days, upon plugging it in the toaster hasn’t reset so it unusable.Extremely disappointed and will never purchase another Breville product in the future.

                The toaster oven w air fry is not an easy thing to clean.  I spend much time trying to keep it looking ok but getting fed up.  I also after purchasing this unit and setting the item up to where i wanted it and giving my other toaster oven to a friend read the booklet to find out this carries a COULD CAUSE CANCER WARNING.   I tried to get info on this from the company.  Was given the run around so i joined the FaceBook group for this item.  Well, after posting a web site that showed that non stick surfaces do cause cancers,...I than was banned from posting for awhile on that site since others were agreeing.  The company is now saying it is the cord but I know better and they have not showed any proof to back it up.  They make is sound like it is just in California where you can get cancer.  What planet do they live on?  When a company is not honest about the product then it is time to start spending your money else where.  I shall post every where since they have tried to play to many games with me and I am now very upset.

                Breville Slow Pro Go. Broke after warranty was up. Breville will not fix my Slow Pro Go pressure cooker. Turned it on one day and it has an error message. No sounds, no explosion just chip failed. They should not make products that cannot be repaired. It's not even three years old. I was offered a small discount on buying a replacement. I did not take them up on this. Unacceptable customer service.

                Lousy customer service. Their ordering system has been down for at least two weeks now for 'maintenance' - embarrassing amount of time needed to maintain a website in 2019, for such a high end company they need to replace their entire IT team if this is the case. Been waiting on the phone now for 20 minutes, every 20 seconds while on hold, I get a prerecorded message telling me to press one to have a specialist call me back, it's so annoying I'm going to shop elsewhere.

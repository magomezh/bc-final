Apple,Technology,1 star: Bad,"What happen to apple.  I have a love hate relationship towrds them. Sadly coustmer support is extremly bad. I dont know if they got lazy or try to downsize cost. But they now pretty much as what google can tell you. Nothing more. I think that steve jobs had been very sad to learn what is happening whit apple.

I had an Iphone 5 that started having troubles this past December 2019.  I finally got a chance to bring it in in January.  I was 5 minutes late for my appoint due to parking.  They cancelled my appoint and said I had to wait a week to schedule another one.  I work 65 miles away, and the only time I could take it in was on weekends.   After enough complaining (remember not more than 5 minutes late) they agreed to fit me in.  Two hours later, right at closing they said it was a bad battery and because they could not remove it, they would give new a refurbished Iphone 5 for just sigh of $60.00.  Well, this refurbish IPhone  lasted 2 months before the screen started getting verticle black and white lines across it and shut off  completely.   I called Apple.  The lady was very nice and agreed that it should have lasted longer than 2 months.  She said Apple would send me a replacement Iphone 5 for free, and that I wouldn't have to leave a credit card.  3 weeks later, the same lady calls me and couldn't be slower saying she made a mistake in writing up the order.   Today (May 7, 2020) I receive an email saying only 2 days left to save the order.  I entered my info and on the next page Ap[ple wanted to charge my credit card for $490.50!    I have a brother and a cousin dying from cancer. and depending on me for help.   I work 65 miles from home.  And these P** leave me hanging for over a month and now want $490.50 from me, for a product they sold me 3 months ago?????????????   Android!

When a company doesn't let you use a phone that you bought outright without their apple id, or their customer rep speaks very poor English, or when they take over a month to send out a password recovery email....well...that tells you everything you need to know about apple customer service. I've never had any such issues with Samsung or any other kind of phone I've used.

I had a trial for Apple TV, and it was for a year.  My nephew accidentally cancelled it on my MacBook Pro.   I tried twice to explain the situation and no assistance was offered.  It was such a degrading experience.  The advisors just shut the chat the window.

I recently decided to change my Apple ID password. More fool me. When I did this, I kept being prompted to change the password multiple times, until I forgot my previous password and was stuck. Naturally with COVID-19 situation and Apple Stores in OZ closed, I could not get immediate help. I had to wait 5 days until I got a message that I could change my Apple ID - which was successful despite their incorrect step-by-step instructions. Since yesterday, I have been prompted to enter my new Apple ID on different devices MULTIPLE times to ensure all apps can be accessed. Just wondering how many times (and days) I have to keep re-entering my password as it is totally tiresome. I also cannot access my older version Apple TV without entering password every time I want to use Apple TV Plus. I so wish I had switched to Android devices last year as Apple is no where near the user friendliness and compatibility I want these days.

I’m using iPhone XS with THREE provider. Nothing works good since October 2019. I’m not sure what causes the issues. It looks like them both are not compatible.  My device doesn’t do essential things most of the time. At my household there are another iPhones, 7 and XS MAX. Only the old 7 on GiffGaff works well. XS MAX struggle as much as XS with THREE. White screen instead web contain. Browsing takes ages and so many times it ends as safari couldn’t open the page. I’m paying £60 a month to having unlimited data. What do I get, frustrations. Can you imagine if you are online banking and your screen goes blank. And lots of other situations when I need to things now. Not when iPhone decides to work.  To help it work everyday numbers of switch off/on, fly mode on/off. Also technical support advice from THREE to clear safari browser history and reset network settings. I feel extremely disappointed. I’ve been happy iPhone user since 2007. Probably not anymore.

Apple,Technology,1 star: Bad,"I called two different times and got three different answers. First time i called to check on my order, the lady said i had to speak to an order review team. She transferred me... to another representative! He told me nothing was wrong and just to wait. I called back to get one more clear answer, this lady also said to wait. So I waited and my order was cancelled because the funds weren't verified by your representatives that told me to wait! YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE REASON I WILL NOT BE BUYING YOUR PRODUCTS. I WILL BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND JUST BECAUSE YOUR SUPPORT SUCKS SWEATY BALLS

2019/2020 MacBook Pro’s are very poorly made.  They had to replace mine as it went wrong within weeks of purchase.  Took nearly a year for apple to rectify and only then after legal proceedings were commenced.  And yes I did have Apple Care Plus. Thought I was buying a great product but clearly they have started to cut corners and drop reliability.

Absolutely fuming with Apple . Ive been a customer for over 10 years , we have 4 children , 2 of whom are young adults . So over The years we’ve had a lot of devices , currently have 4 iPads and 5 iPhones in the house that have cost us a considerable amount over the years and only sent off for a repair once which was about 4 years ago .  My sons iPhone XR has frozen and can not swipe the screen at all and is less than a year old. I sent it off for repair only to of got a message today saying I need to pay £350 . I decided to call them and spoke to a lady who was very polite and said They have to charge me as it has a small crack at the back of the phone . I told them I wasn’t bothered about the crack as it’s never affected the phone and don’t want that repairing just the system fault . She put me thru to a senior member of the team and he was very rude . Didn’t want to listen . Told me they can’t fix it without fixing the crack and that would cost me £350 !  Absolute joke .  Wasn’t interested in anything I had to say . I just expected more from this company ! The amount of money they make. I understand the small crack was my sons fault but it’s never had an affect on the phone and the fault isn’t through that ana is a system fault . They don’t want to charge me for the system fault but won’t fix that without me paying for a new back at a cost of £350 ! Just very rude customer service and pretended he couldn’t even hear me by the end of it and put the phone down on me

I bought a new device in Nov 2019 through Vodafone.  I was never told by Apple or Vodafone about the 1 year free Apple TV promotion . I found out about it a week ago by a friend and then attempted to access it.  After over an hour on the phone with Apple I was told I could no longer get it due to it expiring 90 days after purchase. They would not budge - this is disgusting and so disappointing - whether it’s worth having or not - it’s the principle - they are really pathetic - customer service? Understanding and care especially in theses times? They just don’t care!

Terrible customer service.  The App Store is filled with recurring subscription traps and a nightmare as a single mom to a 7 year old with my phone and password.  I could get a refund for him using my phone to buy game credits for something with robots.  He spent 200 dollars buying the robot and cards for  another game but it’s non refundable.  My kid is going to be churning milk on a farm till he’s 18 and you guys aren’t seeing my business anymore.

We’re a family of Apple products. Just like the simplicity of the iOS system. Never had any issues with any of their phones nor did I expect too if I’m honest.  I did try a Samsung once but sent it back, it just didn’t have the same smoothness of the operating system. That was important to me.

Ordered a Mac mini that when hooked to my Samsung 4K tv would work fine then the screen would turn black then come back on. Called talked to the tech guy and with no run around we both agreed it must be a defective graphics card. He suggested I request a replacement which I did.  Was on the phone a total of 10 minutes between the tech and sales guys. I received the defective unit on Tuesday shipped it back to Apple on Wednesday and received my brand new flawless Mac mini on Friday. Completely amazed at the speed at which they work. Thank you to all involved in resolving my issue so fast. I’m amazed. They even shipped the replacement before they received my return. And I can tell you coming from a 2012 Mac mini to the new model I am completely amazed. It wasn’t cheap but it is well worth the money. Side note I just upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 11 and once again I was blown away.  Have never been disappointed with any of my apple products or the price for what you get.

I am extremely frustrated with Apple and their ‘services’ as I had bought one of their iPhone XS devices BRAND NEW for $1,600, 8 months ago and it no longer charges via lightning cable as the charging port no longer works. I have called them and asked for my options but being currently closed due to covid-19 Apple said my options were limited. I can either ship the device to them for it to get assessed then POTENTIALLY fixed then sent back which could take around a month depending on shipping which I explained I couldn’t do that as i’m an essential worker in this pandemic. Their response to this is “they couldn’t give me a phone to use in the meantime while that process is being done”. My second option was to call and book an appointment with one of their Apple authorised businesses that are still operating to have them look at it - then get back to apple with the issue, to then either fix it at no charge or if the issue being my fault - I pay for it. I was also told it could be caused by using too many different cables which would make the damage my fault so I then have to pay for it. The following day I then called the most local Apple authorised business being 45 minutes from where I live and they then told me that they’re booked out for the next 3 weeks and I have to call weekly to attempt to make a booking - which is almost impossible as they don’t answer the phone and don’t respond to emails. I then asked when’s the best time to call and when do they open the bookings for the next week and they couldn’t give me a day or time expecting me to call daily to get a booking and even if I got the chance to make a booking i’m currently working 6 day weeks from 6am to 4pm as an essential worker and the Apple authorised business closes at 5pm and is not open weekends; making my chances near impossible. I then called back Apple explaining that the two options they had given me weren’t good enough as with covid-19 I’m an essential service working Monday through to Saturday and my phone doesn’t charge. They’ve told me they essentially could not care less. After hours and days of fighting the best option they could come up with was me paying $40 out of pocket, to send in my phone and be without a phone for days and have them return me a MANUFACTURED PHONE - not even a brand new phone!!! I am extremely disgusted that Apple is a multi-billion dollar corporation and they can’t even 1) spare a new phone for a customer who spent thousands on the phone that is STILL UNDER WARRANTY &amp; 2) help out an essential worker who is risking their life to service Australia. Honestly considering spending my money elsewhere from now on and you should too - this isn’t how a successful business should treat their loyal and paying customers - pandemic or not they weren’t going to help me either way. Apple needs to be boycotted.

I used to be a loyal customer. I am very disappointed by Apple product quality and poor customer service. My son accidentally bought Apple music service when he played a word game. I cancelled the purchase on the second when I saw the charge and contacted Apple customer service. They refused to refund for a subscription (cancelled within 24 hours and never used the service). Then I realized that Apple ID didn't work appropriately. I found my phone coul turn on by different faces. What a crap! I bought this Iphone 11 becaUse my old Iphone X no longer took Face ID (after only 1 year use and wasted 3 hours in Apple genius bar but couldn't repair it). I even didn't plan to go fix this stupid face id this time. Only $10.62. But I could see Apple's product quality and customer service getting worse each year!

Their all right, out of all the hardware I've had, my apple equipment has lasted the longest. It's definitely overpriced but the fact that I've used the same computer for over 9 years now really shows that quality is worth the extra cost.

I tried purchasing the iPhone 11 pro twice and every single time I got declined. I called Apple and they told me it was because my bank didn’t send over the funds ? I then talked to me bank and they told me that this is not true. Apple actually got the money and the customer service was not helpful at all. They don’t even know what they’re doing. I’ve never experienced such stupid ppl in my life. I updated all of my card information so there shouldn’t be any issues. I just had a 45min phone call with them and I just kept getting forwarded to different ppl. The last lady kept asking question about what’s important to me in a phone and talked about her personal life which is something i don’t care about. I told her that I just want to know the issue with this purchase and nothing else. She didn’t even know why I was calling no one gave her the information on that neither did she ask what my issue was ? So stupid I swear

Absolutely Terrible. “Fast shipping”. I ordered an Apple Watch and THEN continued to order accessories on amazon and my amazon order came within 2 days like the fast shipping they state. (AMAZON IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!) they know how to FAST deliver like they STATE on their website. Unlike Apple. “Fast shipping” but who knows what UPS is doing with your order. Brilliant Apple. My order It was supposed to arrive last night. No where to be seen. Now Monday? Why? I’m returning the watch. Absolute crap. Figure out your shipping Apple. You have the technology..

0 Stars, Apple replaced a phone thru Apple care and required a credit card hold for the amount of a new phone before they would ship. Apple sent me a “refurbished” non working phone. Apple refuses to send another phone unless I authorize another hold on my credit card for the full amount. You are only allowed two replacements per year, this would use up my last replacement. My business has been without cell service for three days now and Apple could care less. Stay away from Apple.

macOS Catalina is a disgrace - it's so slow you can make a cup of tea while it thinks about basic tasks like opening a standard application.  I thought they beta tested these software upgrades before launching them. I bought a brand new iMac and it prompted me to upgrade when I switched it on and now I'm faced with a new PC that performs like something from the 1990's.

Honestly Apple and the Apple Cash “bank” they have are a giant joke. They treat their customers like s***. If any part of your account/wallet/phone is compromised they’ll just right it off as an authorized transaction just so they don’t have to have any liability for their lack of a more secured system. The phones always break and after a few downloads of “important Apple updates” your stuck having to pay extra for any additional storage(even for apps or data that has nothing to do with actual phone security and more for them to watch what you say/do) honestly anyone who has an android or any company besides Apple is better off Biggest pieces of s*** out there All the company cares about is how to further rip you off on their next “great iPhone” and what random service fees or bull loopholes they place in their contracts

iPhone having problems after 3-4 months of usage.  Apple then tells me repair is not covered due to water damage when the phone hasn't been anywhere close to what they claim the phone can handle.  False adverstisement! Refusal to admit that phone may be faulty in the first place.  Apparently this has been an issue, many people on the internet have written about the same issue. Apple still advertise their product is water resistant but won't cover water damage and blames their customers.

To whom it may concern,    Apple Case# 101070318544  I recently had a business Iphone X get returned to me from a employee. Well they had their icloud account locked. I called Apple Support and was shocked. I have done everything possible to prove ownership of this device. Verizon sent me the form to send to them showing I have ownership of the phone. They responded in (2) days that it wasn't sufficient enough. I am currently on the phone with Verizon about this issue. I paid good money for this phone and now its a paper weight. As a small business owner this is disturbing. One thing is for sure! if this doesn't get resolved soon I will be getting rid of all of my company owned Iphones and never doing business with them again. I agree with protecting the owner of the device But i am the ""Owner"". Just crappy customer service and lack there of...

I am a apple product customer and on my i mac always in the notification keep telling I have system update available so I updated the version and it took almost half day to update, finally when everything fully updated to up to date, I went in to my iMac and started using it, omg I can not believe that my system went so slow, i clock the google chrome and it took ages to come up, everything is very slow now after their update! This is the worst part in apple, I work on this mac now I can even do my architectural works! Apple is doing this purposely because if our system goes down we may looking to spend more money to fix it or buy new one, this is ridiculous! we put our trust in you and pay 1000 bucks but they send the bugs through updates, fooling us!

Our iPhone 6 Plus was having battery issues so my husband called Apple and was instructed by them to take the phone to Best Buy’s for an authentic apple Battery replacement.  We dropped the phone off and paid.  Soon after we get a phone call to my cell notifying us that the battery could not be changed because there was a problem with the mother board not accepting the new battery.  The Geek guy insisted it was a manufacture defect. When we picked up the phone we noticed 2 cracks on the left side of the iPhone screen.  I right away called them from the car and spoke to the manager. After about 75 phone calls  they said  they will take care of it, but here is the BIG problem my husband is a salesman and needs his phone.  So we told them we needed to find a replacement in order to give them the phone to replace the screen.  Well, it wasn’t until months later that my daughter got a new iPhone and lend us her old one.  I called and called and called and no reply, so I personally went in and saw Sergio, he didn’t remember the occurrence and said time had expired and they where no longer repairing the screen on their account.  We tried to reach the CEO of Apple in Cupertino and a nice gentlemen reached out to me and promised he would try and requested a weeks time.  Well, it took him like 4 months and still till today nothing was done and Apple won’t take care of the problem from there Authorized Dealer.  Apple wants us to pay for the screen and battery.  It’s been a battle back and fourth this entire process has been a nightmare.  Apple doesn’t stand behind nothing.  Mr. Banister is just doing his job which only proves Apple is a cheap, heartless, careless company!  They only care about money no customer service at all!  Until today I am still with back and forth communication with Mr Banister with no success and mind you, we sent the original paperwork from The Geek Squad where it says the phone was physically in excellent conditions.   Apple is a Bad Company no backup on their mistakes. In this case they should repair the phone since they recommended and hired Best Buy’s as an Authorized Dealer and the messed up our phone.  This WAS NOT OUR FAULT, it was APPLES fault to alíviate the Apple Store from the battery chaos they created with the updating glitch.  Apple Stand up to your products and mistakes!

Utterly disgraceful. Ordered a MacBook on Thursday to be delivered on Monday. Monday arrives and it tracking says delivery on Tuesday. Tuesday arrives and it’s still ‘processing’ so I call Apple and they assure me it’ll be done by the end of the day to be delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday rolls round and it’s STILL processing so I call again and they say delivery by Thursday. At this rate who knows when I’m going to get my order? It’s already being dispatched six days later than promised! So I’m losing money because I need a new machine for work and Apple won’t even extend to me a ‘good will gesture’.  Oh yeah, and screen time has also become locked out on my phone. I wrote down the password, so I know exactly what it is, but my phone is telling me I have the password wrong. Apparently you can’t remove this without completely resetting your phone and setting up a new Apple ID.   Sick of Apple by this point. Beginning to think I should just buy a pc.

Horrible customer experience. They sent me a replacement product that doesnt work. When I called back they kept trying to make it work, hours on the phone for Airpods?

We IMMEDIATELY DEACTIVATED THE PURCHASE AND CALLED THE CUSTOMER CARE.WE DID NOT USE A SINGLE HOUR. STILL I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT ELSE THESE PEOPLE NEED.  We did not give authorization  to deduct the amount from our  card.I dont understand how they can do the transaction.Its not less amount to ignore.

I dont even have Apple. My kids does. Itunes secretly sign you up to subscriptions when you download free apps. I've paid out over 200 dollars in subscriptions that no one ever signed up for. Then they won't refund you when you discover it. I'll never get Apple myself. They are deceiving.

Great hardware and love the privacy aspect of IOS  compared to android.   Hope apple will find its way back to creating innovative tech, keeping hold of my old iphone 6s at the moment.  However, apple's subscription cancellation policy is pure bovine waste. Until they change that, I will not use it anymore. There are enough alternatives on the market with better policies.

I want to make it known that it’s absolutely criminal for Apple to purposefully slow older product models so that customers are forced to upgrade. I have had my iPhone 8+ for only 2 years. I purchased and financed the phone in March 2018. How convenient for Apple that the month my phone is finally paid off that it starts to have problems nudging me to upgrade. Well I won’t. I had to upgrade to this phone to begin with because they did this with the iPhone 6. My 6 was in fine condition, no older than 2 years old as well but I was forced to upgrade working in a daycare at the time where I couldn’t afford to have my phone dying in ten minutes not even being used. This is CRIMINAL. It should be ILLEGAL. I complied with an upgrade in 2018. Not this time. Apple can take their criminal garbage and stick it where the sun doesn’t shine. Going to be sure to file a lawsuit for this because if I’m going to be forced to upgrade, it surely won’t be coming out of my pocket. Shame on you, Apple. Shame on you for being a billion dollar company who breaks their loyal customer’s arms with stunts like this. I know many others have experienced this kind of frustration but I am over it. I’m not paying to upgrade my phone for no reason except that Apple abuses their upper hand.

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. ABSOLUTELY THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND UNINFORMED, POORLY TRAINED, AND PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you need anything right now from apple, DON'T EXPECT FOR IT TO ARRIVE UNTIL NEARLY A MONTH AFTER (still waiting actually) and don't expect any of the employees to be ""Geniuses""cause they have no idea what they are talking about. I have spoken to them countless times about this issue, and as a student and healthcare worker, I am incredibly upset by not just the complaints of slow shipping, but the glitching and sudden failure of apple products DURING A PANDEMIC. They are absolutely awful and honestly have been for a while. Would highly recommend a PC next time.

My remote does not work. Remote never really worked since I received the remote. Now I can't watch it. I called spectrum and was advised to contact Apple. I spoke with the rude person- Posing a a supervisor. Advising me that my remote is still under warranty, BUT I have to PAY $60.00 for them to send out, and once I send the old remote back I can get me money back. Well, unfortunately I paid bills, and do not have $60 available, and given my funds are different right now. Due to corona. Unable to work overtime, not all my hours. He couldn't even waive it. As a 1st time caller, after telling him my grievance. I HATE APPLE- can't go in the store- THEY DON""T CARE... STILL CAN""T WATCH TV. BUT BEING CHARGED FOR EQUIPMENT MONTHLY.  HATE APPLE TV. I WILL NEVER BUY THESE PRODUCTS- I WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

apple needs to improve I am an apple fan and i had iPhone 5 which was my favorite phone but when I got iPhone X i regretted buying it. i brought iPhone X for almost 1,400 dollars and then in a couple months after it easily broke. It was my only phone and it costed another 300 to 400 dollars to fix my touch screen. it is to expensive and it breaks easily not to mention it is a total rip-off when it comes to repair the damn phone that easily breaks. Also apple needs to improve their IOS system.

While playing a game, I made a purchase in app. Expecting it to be the $4.99 it said it was going to be, I was charged .31 tax. I live in Massachusetts which does not consider digital content taxable. Apple basically said oh well, we decided that yeah you have to pay the tax and we won’t refund your purchase. Needless to say I will NEVER buy another in app anything from apple and am seriously considering going back to android. They don’t pull that BS.

The lid on my AirPods became loose. I contacted Apple customer service hi advised the only option was to either send the case back to Apple for repair under warranty or visit a Apple Service Centre. I explained that I was in isolation due to Covid-19 and I did not want to leave my home thus putting me and my family at risk for none essential travel. I kindly asked whether Apple could extend my warranty until after the lockdown was lifted then I would visit a service centre. Apple refused the extension of the warrant on the AirPod case.

13 inch MacBook Pro’s screen started flickering a month out of the box. Spent hours and hours over months trouble shooting the issue with Apple Care and the Apple store. Logic board and display were replaced under warranty. The flickering issue continued (out of warranty) after these replacements and I continued to try to trouble shoot the issue with Apple. When no resolution occurred I asked for the computer to be replaced. Apple refused. Communicated with executive offices about the issue. Spent more hours trouble shooting the issue with them. In the end the conclusion they came to was that I helped them identify a software bug causing the problem and that they may fix at some point in the future. However they cannot provide any time line or follow to let me know when the issue has been fixed. I should just trust that they will make the fix and wait it out with a computer with a screen that continues flicker. The whole process described took almost two years and I still have a $2500 dollar computer with a display issue that started within a month of unboxing. No resolution. Throughout the process customer service was abysmal: I’ve been blamed, talked down to, sent on a variety of time consuming paths that all led no where (do this test, that test, oh why did that person tell you to do that test? That won’t help, talk to this person, that person, we can’t find any record of your conversation with that person, etc). There’s been no accountability or follow up. Hours of wasted time. Horrible company. Horrible customer service experience. At the end of the day my computer (that did not work from day one) still does not work properly and in addition now has keyboard issues. My only consolation is that reading the reviews here, I realize that many others have had similar experiences with Apple products and service. I was a long time Apple fan who will not be purchasing Apple products in the future. I have learned my lesson.

I will never buy an apple product again. I own an iPhone 5 and the battery only lasts 30 min, and it’s only two years old. Also, now it has recently started to pop up siri every 3 seconds. I’ve turned off the “hey siri” setting and the “press home for siri” option. Apple is the worst. I’m only using Android from this point on.

After spending almost 1 hour and half with technical support, I was told that I had to  send my new phone to be fixed. Basically I was back to square 1.

I want to make it known that it’s absolutely criminal for Apple to purposefully slow older product models so that customers are forced to upgrade. I have had my iPhone 8+ for only 2 years. I purchased and financed the phone in March 2018. How convenient for Apple that the month my phone is finally paid off that it starts to have problems nudging me to upgrade. Well I won’t. I had to upgrade to this phone to begin with because they did this with the iPhone 6. My 6 was in fine condition, no older than 2 years old as well but I was forced to upgrade working in a daycare at the time where I couldn’t afford to have my phone dying in ten minutes not even being used. This is CRIMINAL. It should be ILLEGAL. I complied with an upgrade in 2018. Not this time. Apple can take their criminal garbage and stick it where the sun doesn’t shine. Going to be sure to file a lawsuit for this because if I’m going to be forced to upgrade, it surely won’t be coming out of my pocket. Shame on you, Apple. Shame on you for being a billion dollar company who breaks their loyal customer’s arms with stunts like this. I know many others have experienced this kind of frustration but I am over it. I’m not paying to upgrade my phone for no reason except that Apple abuses their upper hand.

I am an educator that is in desperate need of technology to teach my students from home. I have a school computer but it lacks the capacity to remote teach in an efficient way. I called Apple hoping they could help me through this time but they said they do not do that.  I was willing to purchase a new computer but was hoping they could discount the cost. For such a big company it is disappointing they could not see their way to helping out educators during this crisis. I want the very best for my students and connecting with them has been a struggle. Apple, please think about giving back during this time :((

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. ABSOLUTELY THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND UNINFORMED, POORLY TRAINED, AND PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you need anything right now from apple, DON'T EXPECT FOR IT TO ARRIVE UNTIL NEARLY A MONTH AFTER (still waiting actually) and don't expect any of the employees to be ""Geniuses""cause they have no idea what they are talking about. I have spoken to them countless times about this issue, and as a student and healthcare worker, I am incredibly upset by not just the complaints of slow shipping, but the glitching and sudden failure of apple products DURING A PANDEMIC. They are absolutely awful and honestly have been for a while. Would highly recommend a PC next time.

Going to be sure to file a lawsuit for this because if Iâ€™m going to be forced to upgrade, it surely wonâ€™t be coming out of my pocket. Shame on you, Apple. Shame on you for being a billion dollar company who breaks their loyal customerâ€™s arms with stunts like this. I know many others have experienced this kind of frustration but I am over it. Iâ€™m not paying to upgrade my phone for no reason except that Apple abuses their upper hand.

I am an educator that is in desperate need of technology to teach my students from home. I have a school computer but it lacks the capacity to remote teach in an efficient way. I called Apple hoping they could help me through this time but they said they do not do that.  I was willing to purchase a new computer but was hoping they could discount the cost. For such a big company it is disappointing they could not see their way to helping out educators during this crisis. I want the very best for my students and connecting with them has been a struggle. Apple, please think about giving back during this time :((

Just purchased iPhone 11 Pro less than 3 month and suddenly screen started to glitch, called Apple because of Apple care and was on the phone for over 5 hours trying to get them to send me a new phone since all stores are closed.. spoke with 4 different agents including a manager and they asked me to pay 1100 on hold so they can send me the new phone and once I return it back they will release the money. They are not humans all companies are working with everyone due to covid-19 but APPLE they don’t care... one of the worst companies to do business with...never again

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. ABSOLUTELY THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND UNINFORMED, POORLY TRAINED, AND PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you need anything right now from apple, DON'T EXPECT FOR IT TO ARRIVE UNTIL NEARLY A MONTH AFTER (still waiting actually) and don't expect any of the employees to be ""Geniuses""cause they have no idea what they are talking about. I have spoken to them countless times about this issue, and as a student and healthcare worker, I am incredibly upset by not just the complaints of slow shipping, but the glitching and sudden failure of apple products DURING A PANDEMIC. They are absolutely awful and honestly have been for a while. Would highly recommend a PC next time.

My remote does not work. Remote never really worked since I received the remote. Now I can't watch it. I called spectrum and was advised to contact Apple. I spoke with the rude person- Posing a a supervisor. Advising me that my remote is still under warranty, BUT I have to PAY $60.00 for them to send out, and once I send the old remote back I can get me money back. Well, unfortunately I paid bills, and do not have $60 available, and given my funds are different right now. Due to corona. Unable to work overtime, not all my hours. He couldn't even waive it. As a 1st time caller, after telling him my grievance. I HATE APPLE- can't go in the store- THEY DON""T CARE... STILL CAN""T WATCH TV. BUT BEING CHARGED FOR EQUIPMENT MONTHLY.  HATE APPLE TV.

apple needs to improve I am an apple fan and i had iPhone 5 which was my favorite phone but when I got iPhone X i regretted buying it. i brought iPhone X for almost 1,400 dollars and then in a couple months after it easily broke. It was my only phone and it costed another 300 to 400 dollars to fix my touch screen. it is to expensive and it breaks easily not to mention it is a total rip-off when it comes to repair the damn phone that easily breaks. Also apple needs to improve their IOS system.

The lid on my AirPods became loose. I contacted Apple customer service hi advised the only option was to either send the case back to Apple for repair under warranty or visit a Apple Service Centre. I explained that I was in isolation due to Covid-19 and I did not want to leave my home thus putting me and my family at risk for none essential travel. I kindly asked whether Apple could extend my warranty until after the lockdown was lifted then I would visit a service centre. Apple refused the extension of the warrant on the AirPod case.

13 inch MacBook Pro’s screen started flickering a month out of the box. Spent hours and hours over months trouble shooting the issue with Apple Care and the Apple store. Logic board and display were replaced under warranty. The flickering issue continued (out of warranty) after these replacements and I continued to try to trouble shoot the issue with Apple. When no resolution occurred I asked for the computer to be replaced. Apple refused. Communicated with executive offices about the issue. Spent more hours trouble shooting the issue with them. In the end the conclusion they came to was that I helped them identify a software bug causing the problem and that they may fix at some point in the future. However they cannot provide any time line or follow to let me know when the issue has been fixed. I should just trust that they will make the fix and wait it out with a computer with a screen that continues flicker. The whole process described took almost two years and I still have a $2500 dollar computer with a display issue that started within a month of unboxing. No resolution. Throughout the process customer service was abysmal: I’ve been blamed, talked down to, sent on a variety of time consuming paths that all led no where (do this test, that test, oh why did that person tell you to do that test? That won’t help, talk to this person, that person, we can’t find any record of your conversation with that person, etc). There’s been no accountability or follow up. Hours of wasted time. Horrible company. Horrible customer service experience. At the end of the day my computer (that did not work from day one) still does not work properly and in addition now has keyboard issues. My only consolation is that reading the reviews here, I realize that many others have had similar experiences with Apple products and service. I was a long time Apple fan who will not be purchasing Apple products in the future. I have learned my lesson.

Update2: Guess what I had at my door step today. A package from Apple, that was promised not be delivered to me by several customer representatives. On top of that, I couldn't just give it back to UPS, because return shipping was with Fedex!!! Absolutely unacceptable. Horrible experience with apple. That a package couldn't have been taken back 45 min after I placed my order is beyond my comprehension. That service representatives just hang op on me, leave chats, etc. even though I'm simply asking them to call UPS to intercept my package.  I was offered no compensation for the mess whatsoever. Since it's Thursday my package won't be returned until next week and then I'll have to wait 5 days for my refund. Absolutely horrible company. Makes billions but can't help out a teleworking customer who needs a better machine for work at home. I should have gotten my gift card payments back. Instead, I had to increase my exposure risk to the virus. Thanks Apple  Update: They shipped it this morning at 6 AM. I can't believe this. The representative on the phone assured me it wouldn't be shipped. Now I have to go to the UPS store to return it, all while we're under ""stayathome"" order. The person I chatted with just left the chat, after I asked them to contact UPS to intercept the package. I am absolutely furious about this. Apple used to have good customer service. It's gotten absolutely unacceptable. Will not buy from apple again after I used my apple store card.  This is a review for an issue with their customer service and their ordering options I just experienced. I ordered an iMac, but changed my mind about it and wanted to get a different one just 30 min later. So I tried to login online to cancel my order. An error occurred, so I started chatting with one of their representatives. First I asked if I can switch my order. She asked me so many questions and would not understand what I wanted to do. 20 min later when I finally got her to understand that I wanted to cancel my order, she writes ""Oooh..., it's too late now, because they already shipped it"". What the heck. In theory fast shipping sounds great. But man Apple, give your customer an hour of a grace period so we can change our order within an hour, if we need to! It was literally marked in process for shipping within 45 min. I paid with an apple store gift card, so now I can't just order a new one. No, I have to wait for my order to get here, then send it back to Apple, then wait for my refund, then place a new order. If the representative would have just cancelled my order within the first 5 min, this wouldn't have happened. I'm so upset at the inefficiency of this... I'm teleworking because of COVID-19 right now and need a better computer for data processing, since I can't work in my office. Now I have to wait probably more than a week. Yes I changed my mind about an order, but common that happens. The representative should have been way more on top of things. I called and they are processing a return and the representative on the phone literally interrupted me to just try to issue a return as quickly as possible, because she understood how frustrating that was. I think Apple should refund me immediately, instead of me having to wait for the return, because this was the fault of their customer service being so slow!  Just if anyone is interested. I wanted to change my order because I realized that you cannot change the RAM in the 21.5"" iMac models yourself, but you can in the 27"". This is ridiculous by the way. Money over costumer satisfaction for this company seems to be the motto.

Apple refuses to take accountability or to check if they do have a hack problem. They will not help you if this ever happens.

Despite being the manufacturer and supplier of the product I ordered, Apple has somehow managed to delay the order I placed for three to four weeks when every other supplier was able to ship them out the next day (and this was for a product that was in stock on the day I ordered it). What's more, Apple didn't think it important to tell their customer that the item had been delayed this long, nor felt it necessary to apologise in any way.

For the price you pay for so called superior Apple products you would think their customer service would be amazing.  Unfortunately as i have discovered having to use it lately it is perhaps the worst out there. My I pad developed a fault well within warranty of course and the wriggling and squirming Apple did to try to get out of fixing my issue was nothing short of astonishing. Eventually due to pure persistence on my part they agreed to fix my product so good of them. Will never purchase a Apple product again, really bad service!

I will not buy an apple product again.  Sure they have a nice laptop which I bought, but since then after several updates it crashed on me more than once.  I have lost so much time to fix it.  I used their support once and at the end when they couldn't figure it out they just stopped following up with me.  Had an old 2011 macbook, HD died and it was impossible to get internet recovery to work it just to get the image just to pay big dollars for them to fix it.  ipads get obsolete so fast and now with them settling for how they treated the iphone users restricting its performance to save battery.

Today was one of the most horrible days since this lock down due to the  Covid-19. I have young  children and  trying to  keep them occupied could be very challenging. For this reason, I purchased several  Apple Devices.  The past month, I have been trying to get in contact with the Apple Support team, to try to reset my password for my Apple ID, it has been 15 days since I've been waiting to receive a recovery email or someone that will contact me from Apple. Today, I decided to call Apple to escalate to a supervisor. I spoke to the supervisor who could not provide any additional service or help to resolve the  matter at hand, In fact,she was clueless. She made the situation  worse. So now, I'm stuck with two devices that I've paid a lot of money and unable to get access to. I had tried all the required  processes to  recover my  password. I have spoken to many Apple Support and receive no conclusion to my problem.  I have tried everything that they ask me to do.  Be patent Go to forget my password.  Reset the devices Create a new Apple ID  Use another Device   No Apple Supporter or Apple Supervisor  knows  the step to recovering a password.  According to the floor supervisor,she is the highest person to speak to, and she does not know anything about the steps to follow.   Apple pride themselves  on how great their devices are, how about providing training to the Apple Support Team so they will  know detail by detail how to handle customer concern with care.

I went past that day at different times, it was open all day and the guy who works there told me they had two UPS deliveries that day, but nothing with my reference number. Went to UPS sorting office. Item not been scanned, so impossible to find. Received email stating delivery will be reattempted on 27th to a (made up) unrelated address. Unable to contact UPS customer service, and Apple customer service told me the access location is closed, despite me telling him it’s not, offering him time stamped photographic evidence it was not closed, yet still went on to insist that it was closed. It seems with Apple the customer is not only wrong, but wrong even in the face of incontrovertible evidence! Shame!

I went past that day at different times, it was open all day and the guy who works there told me they had two UPS deliveries that day, but nothing with my reference number. Went to UPS sorting office. Item not been scanned, so impossible to find. Received email stating delivery will be reattempted on 27th to a (made up) unrelated address. Unable to contact UPS customer service, and Apple customer service told me the access location is closed, despite me telling him itâ€™s not, offering him time stamped photographic evidence it was not closed, yet still went on to insist that it was closed. It seems with Apple the customer is not only wrong, but wrong even in the face of incontrovertible evidence! Shame!

Apple is terrible I bought a MacBook Air with 128 Gb of storage but 91 Gb is used by the system alone. It has no really useful applications built in (you have to download them if they're even compatible). you can't use this computer for much if anything, movies look terrible the writing program is usually untransferable. I would not recommend buying apple. 0/10

i had purchased apple iphone 11 from Arora Mobile Shop, Aligarh on 13-11-2019. Apple Company insure to the customers about his privacy, securities. but now i am frustrated about his securities point. on 7-march-2020 i had lost my phone on GT Road Aligarh. Next day i was filed a FIR in Banna Devi Thana Aligarh. after that police tracked my mobile by surveillance and then we get the location of Mumbai.  and i had also got the link of FINDMYAPP for find the mobile, i was personally tracked my mobile through that app. 11-march-2020 my phone was on, and then after some time (on same day) he (that person who use my phone currently) break my privacy lock and insert his own sim.

I have an issue with an iphone that I bought from the Arden Fair Apple Store in July of 2019. Between trouble shooting with Verizon and Apple customer service, we've identified that it is likely a known Apple issue that is covered by the company, once confirmed. With all of the local apple stores shutdown for COVID-19, I have to mail it in without a loaner phone which was quoted to take 10 days to 4 weeks. Waiting 4 weeks for a phone that I use for multi-factor authentication to be able to work from home is unacceptable. I recognize that they have a number of challenges in this unprecedented time but their consumers do as well. I have to be able to work from home. I came up will a few creative solutions such as having them pay the trade in credit as if the phone was fully functional and I'd buy the newest model. If the diagnostics came back as another issue that wasn't covered by apple, they can charge my card back for the credit. Another option would be to allow me to purchase a phone and return it, if they are able to fix it under their warranty. Both options, were rejected. The only solutions involve me purchasing another phone at full price without a credit for what's likely a defect in a phone I bought from their store in July or waiting 10 days - 4 weeks for them to resolve the issue (that's after I wait two days for them to send me a box to ship it to them). This isn't an acceptable option when I need it to work from home. We own three iphones in our house (XR and two 7s that we were planning to upgrade), a Macbook Pro, and 2 pairs of airpods. For a situation where Apple could have worked with us and given me the $120 trade-in credit on a $1000 phone and even charged me back if it wasn't a warranty covered issue, they lost Apple customers for life.  The new plan is to go to Costco and buy the latest Samsung Galaxy today while they repair the other phone for me to resell online. I'm sure between the time they spent talking to me on the phone, shipping my phone back and forth, paying for an appointment at a local authorized non-apple phone repair store, running diagnostics and fixing the issue.

I bought the IPhone 11 Jan 30th 2020 after my IPhone 6 was failing . I was told by the apple store It would take awhile to get use to it . The phone was a mess from day one , the touch screen was not sensitive, face recognition didn’t work , my calls would drop ( every single call ) , all my apps on my phone wouldn’t work ( Facebook, YouTube etc ) it didn’t matter which one . So after about 7-10 days I thought this is not something I am doing it has to be the phone annnnd then the real hell began !  I made my first call to customer service and I’ll just try to keep it short , after about 20 calls to customer service including talking with several senior advisors, taking my phone in to Best Buy , factory resetting my phone , blaming my carrier I’ve had for 12 years I was told there is nothing wrong with my phone .  Now through this process I admit I lost it and cried - I told the senior advisors I’m crying over a damn phone , I give up ! I have owned IPhones from the beginning ( after we all had the flip ) I AM team IPhone . Why would anyone spend this much of their time and energy dealing with tech support if nothing was wrong ?  I didn’t ask for a refund but I asked for a exchange on the phone ( Best Buy had checked mine ) mine was / is in mint condition and was told “ If you bought a new car and a sensor light was bad would you want a new car ?”  My reply was “ If I bought a new car and the engine blew within two weeks I would want a new car .”   So I still have a IPhone 11 that is a bad apple and instead of this company making it right which would be easy for them ( it was 2 weeks old ) here I am today 😞 .  Honestly I don’t even want to talk to another person at Apple after crying over frustration/ phone I’ve had enough .  **** I’m not tech savvy and I just found this site so anyone can take this review how they want , it was my experience!

If I could give 0 stars I would right now!!! Ive had an apple phone for over 7 years. I have always been happy with the customer service until today!!!!!  I cant believe a supervisor would give me as much trouble to help me correct and issue that they caused . Literally considering switching . And when I switch so will all 6 lines in my account.  I will also be advising the office I work for. No one should ever be treated this way!!!

I can’t believe how poorly I have been treated by the team at Apple, especially during such a difficult period.  - i had a MacBook Air for just over 2 years ( bought in September 2017) which broke, I tried to get a repair and was informed the model was faulty and had been discontinued by Apple as it was built without a fan. It was out of warranty by this stage but still not a reliable or economical product for the price  - I had to replace my computer as I’ve been forced to work from home due to the COVI19 I bought a brand new MacBook Pro last week - on the first day it started to malfunction and the helpline told me the computer appeared to be faulty after they walked me through the steps to reset my new MacBook, it never turned back on - I spoke to the help line and they told me to bring it into the Genius Bar, when I got there it was closed due to the lockdown for 2 weeks. The store is not near my house so it would have been helpful to let me know this information on the phone - I went through 5 representatives before I could speak to a manager she informed me that the store was opened just for one day for existing clients who need support and told me she updated my case notes and they would be expecting me at the store if I rushed.  - I only was told this an hour before the official shutdown. Left work early, jumped in an Uber which cost me $35 to get to the Apple store on time - when I arrived they said there was no notes on my file and denied me from entering the store.  I cried and told the man at the door what had happened and he told me I was endangering everyone’s health and was extremely cold, letting other customers through for repairs.  - I called the hotline again who tried to get through to the store but was unsuccessful, they apologised for everything that had happened and promised they would do everything to help me and would call me back - when a representative called me back he said all the could do was send it in for a repairs ( in a new computer I haven’t even used yet) but I would have to take it more then 2 hours each way on public transport to have a technician look at it or wait until they reopen, which appears to be indefinite  - I told him this wasn’t an option. I spent all my saving $2000 on a new computer so I could work from home and keep my job during a scary period, if they couldn’t return the item for me even through their online store I just want to sent the faulty computer back and I obtain a refund so I can buy a computer from Microsoft - I don’t have any more saving and I was relying on that computer to keep my job. Now I have no work and Apple have taken my $2000 and left me with a faulty MacBook I can not even turn on I am just so sad that you could treat a human being like this - I explained this to the representative and when I started to cry he said I’m going to hang up now, that was the end of the call. - I have emailed the manager who promised me they would handle the case due to their poor management last week, yet I have emailed twice since then and no reply. - we are about to go into lock down, I have four more days to resolve this issue otherwise I won’t have a job next week, I have no more income coming in and now I am down $2000  Please Apple, I can’t believe this is your customer service, you have stolen my money in a time of extreme need

I would give zero, given the option.   They forced my mother to pay for a translation app she never used, downloaded or subscribed to in any shape way or form.   Your charging cables are triple F rating and are prone to being broken.   No ability to do any kind of self-repair.   Company takes no responsibility for sub-par products or horrible corporate policies. What do you mean I only have two weeks to return an unwanted product? Why should I have to pay for a new product when I should be able to repair it myself? Why use specialized, nonstandard components in production when standard parts are readily available?  The customer is being shafted left and right by these anti-consumer practices.   They make Nokia look like a God-king, the Emperor of War-hammer 40K by comparison, and that says a lot.   Company has been declining in quality of products and services since Steve Job's death.   Apple Mac computer broke down on my three years ago and I never went back to it since. Overpriced, low quality products that only look good with no capability to get things done. Computers are nothing but expensive Facebook machines.   My recommendation for existing and potential customers; Always go for Androids in terms of phones. Always go to Windows or Linux or any other open-source/common OS - MacOS and iOS is nonsense and makes computing experience worse than Windows or Linux.

I have been with IPhones for 8 years  . I have always had some problems with the battery , but  it was something I could live with by charging it more often and carrying the pocket juice battery around. This time I have upgraded to IPhone 8 and only owned it for 6 months. My battery would drop  from  being fully charged to 100 % to 10% within seconds of use and would start restarting, but never able to use it again unless plugged right into the charger. I went to apple store in Calgary and was told the battery has a corrosion from moisture??? This is IPhone 8 and it is water resistant according to the description of the characteristics. Never mind it has never even been dropped into water/snow/etc. I was told that the warranty doesn’t cover same and there’s nothing they could do for me. They offered me to buy a new phone!!!  I also contacted  Apple customer service on the phone and spoke to the senior advisor and he also said they had to go with the store notes and could not help me in this case. I have been a loyal customer of the Apple products for the last 8 years. It leaves me in a great dissatisfaction with the service and the attitude of the company. Will have to look for another device and in the future it will never be the Apple again .

Disappointing... My iPhone 7 microphone stopped working and Apple accepted it was a manufacturing fault. They replaced it with a new iPhone 7, which has been plagued with issues ever since. Restarting the phone, downloading the latest software, deleting apps etc etc ad infinitum does not work. Apples hilarious solution, in the middle of a global pandemic, is to send the phone in for repair, leaving me without a phone during the worst epidemic globally since Spanish Flu. My love affair with Apple has now ended and the iPhone, iMac (x2), iPad, MacBook, and all of the older models accrued will all be used to end of life, and then it will be time to switch to a responsible company that manufactures things that last, and do not have built in obsolescence. Adieu Apple.....

I would give zero, given the option.   They forced my mother to pay for a translation app she never used, downloaded or subscribed to in any shape way or form.   Your charging cables are triple F rating and are prone to being broken.   No ability to do any kind of self-repair.   Company takes no responsibility for sub-par products or horrible corporate policies. What do you mean I only have two weeks to return an unwanted product? Why should I have to pay for a new product when I should be able to repair it myself? Why use specialized, nonstandard components in production when standard parts are readily available?  The customer is being shafted left and right by these anti-consumer practices.   They make Nokia look like a God-king, the Emperor of War-hammer 40K by comparison, and that says a lot.   Company has been declining in quality of products and services since Steve Job's death.   Apple Mac computer broke down on my three years ago and I never went back to it since. Overpriced, low quality products that only look good with no capability to get things done. Computers are nothing but expensive Facebook machines.   My recommendation for existing and potential customers; Always go for Androids in terms of phones. Always go to Windows or Linux or any other open-source/common OS - MacOS and iOS is nonsense and makes computing experience worse than Windows or Linux.

I have been with IPhones for 8 years  . I have always had some problems with the battery , but  it was something I could live with by charging it more often and carrying the pocket juice battery around. This time I have upgraded to IPhone 8 and only owned it for 6 months. My battery would drop  from  being fully charged to 100 % to 10% within seconds of use and would start restarting, but never able to use it again unless plugged right into the charger. I went to apple store in Calgary and was told the battery has a corrosion from moisture??? This is IPhone 8 and it is water resistant according to the description of the characteristics. Never mind it has never even been dropped into water/snow/etc. I was told that the warranty doesn’t cover same and there’s nothing they could do for me. They offered me to buy a new phone!!!  I also contacted  Apple customer service on the phone and spoke to the senior advisor and he also said they had to go with the store notes and could not help me in this case. I have been a loyal customer of the Apple products for the last 8 years. It leaves me in a great dissatisfaction with the service and the attitude of the company. Will have to look for another device and in the future it will never be the Apple again .

Disappointing... My iPhone 7 microphone stopped working and Apple accepted it was a manufacturing fault. They replaced it with a new iPhone 7, which has been plagued with issues ever since. Restarting the phone, downloading the latest software, deleting apps etc etc ad infinitum does not work. Apples hilarious solution, in the middle of a global pandemic, is to send the phone in for repair, leaving me without a phone during the worst epidemic globally since Spanish Flu. My love affair with Apple has now ended and the iPhone, iMac (x2), iPad, MacBook, and all of the older models accrued will all be used to end of life, and then it will be time to switch to a responsible company that manufactures things that last, and do not have built in obsolescence. Adieu Apple.....

Jeg så Apples nye serie The Morning Show, den anden dag og føler virkelig ikke at Apple så stort et selskab kan være bekendt at sende en TV-serie ud i offentligheden, hvor der bliver bandet så meget! De bruger ord som F-ord og s-ord. Hvordan kan dette være i orden? Apple har et ansvar for at tale ordentligt.

It is very difficult to contact the support since I bought my MacBook Pro 2017 in September (the 1st week crashed three times!!!). It’s very difficult to tell them what are the problems to try to fix it (get stuck many times in mail, preview, and sometimes it’s like working with windows vista even browsing their website) and the performance is getting worse and worse. So not happy with the product as I was before, and very disappointed with the customer care support. If I could, I would have bought a chrome book. I hate also the fact that I cannot their apps on the App Store...

Had a 7 day trial for an app, the reminder in my phone somehow didn’t work so i got charged almost £30 for an app for the YEAR, called up the day it renewed so hadn’t used the app and spoke to two advisors, both refused my request for a refund so now I’m out of pocket for an app I don’t even use or want. Fair enough if i left it days or weeks but the day after? Also even tried to come to a compromise and asked if I could just pay for a month but no nothing was done so won’t be bothering with even trying any apps now. Any other companies like Microsoft always help out in situations like this so apple should do the same.

Screens don't last and you end up paying £160 just to fix the screen. Mine broke 4 months after being repaired in the Apple shop in Bristol with a screen protector on. I honestly think they do cheap ones on purpose to get your money as there's not even a warranty that covers it. I'm sure Apple know they will break shortly...so they make lots of Money from it.  Don't buy an apple phone. Will rip you off.

So I purchased ~15 Macbook Pro i9 (top model) in summer 2018. In 9 months it died due to swollen battery. It was fixed under warranty (logic board, CPU, memory, SSD, keyboard, trackpad, part of case were replaced). In about 3 months after that screen was replaced because of dust inside (12-15 pixels in size). Now, after 1.5 years since purchase battery is swollen again (confirmed in service, need to make backup and send on another 2 weeks repair). Honestly, not something I expect from purchase of top model of macbook pro.

My iphone 10 internet doesn’t work. Went to apple store in chicago downtown and they found that it can’t be fixed because antenna is bad. I have phone for a little more then a year. They told me that it will not be covered and that I have to pay 600$. I started arguing they called security and took me out. It is horrible, I have no words to explain how did I feel as loyal customer for 10 years . This is what big corporations do. Getting big because of customers and then practice power on customer, security told me he will take me to jail I almost punch him....very very bad experience...

Had Macbook Pro early 2015 model purchased February 22, 2016. Noticed screen delaminating so called AppleCare. Was told it may be covered under the extended warranty but they will have to have a person look at it so they booked me an appointment at the store. Checked in and rep said that it was no longer covered under 4 year extended screen warranty as I was 10 days past. He showed me the details that were typed in by AppleCare during our phone call. This showed I supposedly talked to a rep and then a supervisor and was told the screen repair would not be covered under warranty, and if I wanted it fixed outside warranty I would have to go to a Mac store. I told the rep that is not what I was told and I only spoke to one person. I requested they pull up the phone recording to confirm (no go ... those are only to support the company not the customer). The store rep said he can do nothing but I can call Apple Care again. I did this from the noisy store (loud music + some presentation going on at same time) and was put forward to upper support. Over the next 40 minutes I was asked questions and then told they cannot do anything as I am 10 days over. Apparently the warranty starts when you purchase the system. Too bad to me I ordered via our university portal and it shipped from China ... so I never even received the system until March. And my system showed initial file creations were March 28.  Main point is if they would have told me my screen would not be covered, as they stated they did, on the phone I would not have driven 1 hour to the Store and spent 2 hours at the Store.   I switched to Mac 4 years ago with MacPro server system at work, Macbook Pro, ipad, iphone ... all under AppleCare and never a single claim. After this I am divesting in all my Apple products. I was going to wait for a new 13"" Macbook Pro to come out with the better keyboard but now have ordered a HP Elitebook. Looking for replacements for my other Apple devices. Being treated the way I was is an insult. Having Apple write outright lies on their phone system report is worse.

seriously .. how does this company even survive. I guess there are a lot of sheep in this world that are happy to pay a high price for sub-par products.  There phones are horrible and restricted. I got locked into the Apple eco-system because my work gave me an iPhone for work - everything is proprietary connection, apps, accessories.   When I left the company and had to hand the phone back, I decided to try an Android phone (Samsung S series). Oh my word - such freedom - so many add-ons, apps, accessories that all use open standards. Following that my family also started to move out of the Apple eco-system and we are all happy with having Android as our  mobile phone platform and Windows 10 as our laptop/desktop platform.

Apple has a rotten core and you only discover it if you dare to trouble them with a concern or issue with your device. A new iMac purchased in 2016 presented problems within a few weeks of taking ownership - I flagged this to Apple who offered a remote support ""guru"" who took me through first level diagnostics, offered to help if problems persisted and then went MIA. I have a record of dozens of messages in the four years I've had this computer and its just steadily gotten worse and worse. Finally after a rather aggressive attempt to get their attention and demanding my money back they offer to get the iMac checked out so the problem can be identified and a suitable resolution found. The iMac was proven to have both faulty hardware and software - so the evidence of four years of pain is clear.  Instead of compensating, replacing the faulty iMac the machine was partially repaired with a new logic board but the software issue remained.  Apple suggested that was all they were prepared to do.   I can say with certainty that whilst Apple presents as a cool and attractive brand it simply does not bear close inspection.  This is a rotten to the core outfit with draconian policies.  A once loyal customer lost. Legal action now commencing.  As an aside I was blown away with this Trustpilot score....how poor is this business?

I have a terrible story to share. My uncle is an 80 decorated vietnam veteran who served our country for 30 years. Steve suffers from PTSD. My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Holly’s password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Holly’s phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Holly’s phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Holly’s phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steve’s phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone. For the Apple employees involved in this case, I hope your loved one never has to experience this!

Where do I begin.,..... I have had apple products as long as I can remember. I have faithfully bought literally every new update on the iphone and all accessories you have to offer. I go on vacation with a new Mac Pro a new iPhone ten new iPods an iwatch and all the attachments you have made me purchase. I sit next to everyone on the last three flights, brought all my apple products to keep me occupied and here i sit... watching everyone around me with non apple products connecting to wifi watching movies, tv shows, you tube.. all are connect to their head set that is not an iPods set.... and here I sit with no  access.. I can't even connect my iPod to my Mac Pro, I can't watch youtube or Netflix or even get on the southwest server. I have been traveling in total car ride, plane, layovers for 7 hours and I have not been able to access a thing. it is not my service it is not the connection it is simply your product that has gone down the hole. It has glitches and complications that no one else seems to experience. I am everything apple and I am sitting here writing an email out of pure frustration verse watching a movie like everyone else around me. what is gong on with this company. my iPhone ten is by far the worst phone I have ever had from you guys and I owned an iPhone 4. I really hope I didn't waste my money. I own everything from an iwatch to an iPhone, to a Mac Pro, iPad, to a Ipods. and this is what I have to deal with. I am a walking apple commercial who can't access full wifi ever. I might have to move on and accept that you guys are going in the wrong direction which is super disappointing. I want to point out that all I can access is email. why? why can I not access anything else?

I don’t like the new version. I have to download all my documents every time I go to Books and if I don’t have a very good internet signal i can’t access it. It’s costing me time and money. I work with my phone all the time. I hope that you fix this soon!!

Grent from Edmonton mall apple store Who is so rude telling us that are you abandoning  the 5 series watch.. which we bring to them for twice already saying the problem is just software.. I’m just wondering if you are in our shoes do you think you will trust the watch who had issue twice saying we put faith on our technician.. my question is this what happen if in further future that happens again and it is not under anymore of warranty how can you help us.. how can we put faith on the that product.. common don’t be ridiculous that you will not ask for a replacement if you are in our situation., just because it’s not your you don’t care..

Had Macbook Pro early 2015 model purchased February 22, 2016. Noticed screen delaminating so called AppleCare. Was told it may be covered under the extended warranty but they will have to have a person look at it so they booked me an appointment at the store. Checked in and rep said that it was no longer covered under 4 year extended screen warranty as I was 10 days past. He showed me the details that were typed in by AppleCare during our phone call. This showed I supposedly talked to a rep and then a supervisor and was told the screen repair would not be covered under warranty, and if I wanted it fixed outside warranty I would have to go to a Mac store. I told the rep that is not what I was told and I only spoke to one person. I requested they pull up the phone recording to confirm (no go ... those are only to support the company not the customer). The store rep said he can do nothing but I can call Apple Care again. I did this from the noisy store (loud music + some presentation going on at same time) and was put forward to upper support. Over the next 40 minutes I was asked questions and then told they cannot do anything as I am 10 days over. Apparently the warranty starts when you purchase the system. Too bad to me I ordered via our university portal and it shipped from China ... so I never even received the system until March. And my system showed initial file creations were March 28.  Main point is if they would have told me my screen would not be covered, as they stated they did, on the phone I would not have driven 1 hour to the Store and spent 2 hours at the Store.   I switched to Mac 4 years ago with MacPro server system at work, Macbook Pro, ipad, iphone ... all under AppleCare and never a single claim. After this I am divesting in all my Apple products. I was going to wait for a new 13"" Macbook Pro to come out with the better keyboard but now have ordered a HP Elitebook. Looking for replacements for my other Apple devices. Being treated the way I was is an insult. Having Apple write outright lies on their phone system report is worse.

seriously .. how does this company even survive. I guess there are a lot of sheep in this world that are happy to pay a high price for sub-par products.  There phones are horrible and restricted. I got locked into the Apple eco-system because my work gave me an iPhone for work - everything is proprietary connection, apps, accessories.   When I left the company and had to hand the phone back, I decided to try an Android phone (Samsung S series). Oh my word - such freedom - so many add-ons, apps, accessories that all use open standards. Following that my family also started to move out of the Apple eco-system and we are all happy with having Android as our  mobile phone platform and Windows 10 as our laptop/desktop platform.

Settings changed after an update without asking me and I’ve now lost all my precious messages from people important to me. I can’t now get them back, been on chat with them for 1 and a half hours this evening and been told they are unrecoverable.

Apple has a rotten core and you only discover it if you dare to trouble them with a concern or issue with your device. A new iMac purchased in 2016 presented problems within a few weeks of taking ownership - I flagged this to Apple who offered a remote support ""guru"" who took me through first level diagnostics, offered to help if problems persisted and then went MIA. I have a record of dozens of messages in the four years I've had this computer and its just steadily gotten worse and worse. Finally after a rather aggressive attempt to get their attention and demanding my money back they offer to get the iMac checked out so the problem can be identified and a suitable resolution found. The iMac was proven to have both faulty hardware and software - so the evidence of four years of pain is clear.  Instead of compensating, replacing the faulty iMac the machine was partially repaired with a new logic board but the software issue remained.  Apple suggested that was all they were prepared to do.   I can say with certainty that whilst Apple presents as a cool and attractive brand it simply does not bear close inspection.  This is a rotten to the core outfit with draconian policies.  A once loyal customer lost. Legal action now commencing.  As an aside I was blown away with this Trustpilot score....how poor is this business?

I have a terrible story to share. My uncle is an 80 decorated vietnam veteran who served our country for 30 years. Steve suffers from PTSD. My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Holly’s password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Holly’s phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Holly’s phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Holly’s phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steve’s phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone. For the Apple employees involved in this case, I hope your loved one never has to experience this!

My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Hollyâ€™s password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Hollyâ€™s phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Hollyâ€™s phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Hollyâ€™s phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steveâ€™s phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone. For the Apple employees involved in this case, I hope your loved one never has to experience this!

Where do I begin.,..... I have had apple products as long as I can remember. I have faithfully bought literally every new update on the iphone and all accessories you have to offer. I go on vacation with a new Mac Pro a new iPhone ten new iPods an iwatch and all the attachments you have made me purchase. I sit next to everyone on the last three flights, brought all my apple products to keep me occupied and here i sit... watching everyone around me with non apple products connecting to wifi watching movies, tv shows, you tube.. all are connect to their head set that is not an iPods set.... and here I sit with no  access.. I can't even connect my iPod to my Mac Pro, I can't watch youtube or Netflix or even get on the southwest server. I have been traveling in total car ride, plane, layovers for 7 hours and I have not been able to access a thing. it is not my service it is not the connection it is simply your product that has gone down the hole. It has glitches and complications that no one else seems to experience. I am everything apple and I am sitting here writing an email out of pure frustration verse watching a movie like everyone else around me. what is gong on with this company. my iPhone ten is by far the worst phone I have ever had from you guys and I owned an iPhone 4. I really hope I didn't waste my money. I own everything from an iwatch to an iPhone, to a Mac Pro, iPad, to a Ipods. and this is what I have to deal with. I am a walking apple commercial who can't access full wifi ever. I might have to move on and accept that you guys are going in the wrong direction which is super disappointing. I want to point out that all I can access is email. why? why can I not access anything else?

I don’t like the new version. I have to download all my documents every time I go to Books and if I don’t have a very good internet signal i can’t access it. It’s costing me time and money. I work with my phone all the time. I hope that you fix this soon!!

Should take less than 10 days to receive including my ship back of the faulty product. From this point on the process became a circus of no responsibility, lack of support, poor follow thru and constant excuses with corporate buzz words. I am now working with my third senior advisor. She just called to tell me that the factory has received my old computer. I asked when the replacement will be sent to me since the whereabouts of my old one isn’t very relevant.

Why would apple partner with one of the most greedy and toxic companies in the world for their credit card?? They find creative ways to charge you late fees, even if you pay on time. Customer service is disgustingly rude and unhelpful. Learn from my mistake, and avoid this card!!!

Went into Apple store drake circus Plymouth At 9.30 am today to discuss And view a MacBook Pro which I was considering buying for my son. I was told the item I was looking at for £1,299.00 would be reduced by 10%. I was also advised this item came with a 3 year warranty. After arranging my finances I called the store and spoke to Ari - he told be I was not eligible for the 10% discount as I wasn’t a student. He also told me the item had a 12 month warranty and if I wanted the 3 year Apple care plus it would cost an additional £249.00.    I have spent my day visiting the store, rearranging finances and when I make contact to purchase The item I am told the information a staff member gave me was inaccurate and in my view completely misleading!   Thanks Apple - shocking !!!

I’ve been a loyal Apple consumer for 15 years. The products are sexy, shiny, and ( used to be) in the forefront of technology. I have a MacBook Pro 3 years old. It has been non working since January 10, 2020. And in Apples care since January 26, 2020. It is February 16,2020 and I still don’t have a laptop. This might be acceptable if it were being fixed however, I was told by a senior on January 10 that there have been too serviced on the laptop for the same problem and that I’m a candidate for a replacement laptop. Should take less than 10 days to receive including my ship back of the faulty product. From this point on the process became a circus of no responsibility, lack of support, poor follow thru and constant excuses with corporate buzz words. I am now working with my third senior advisor.

She couldn’t answer that and said she needs time to reach out to her team to find out ship schedule of the new computer. So, I’ve been waiting 5 days for my follow up call to tell me noting. This is absolutely ludicrous. Other details that have happened are: being told by support to take laptop into a store and have them ship it to Apple since no one knew why Fed Ex didn’t pick it up. The store shipped it out and it came back days later repaired not replaced. No one knew why since the paperwork clearly states REPLACEMENT. Apple support could not answer why.  After 5 more days of waiting Apple care informs me to go to the store and pick up my old computer and Fed Ex would pick it up in several days. Why would I waste my time picking up something that was already in the hands of the place to be shipped. Apparently the store that had it refused to ship it back. After many phone calls they decided to ship it. There have been plenty of other unpleasant exchanges. Bottom line APPLE SUPPORT is hardly supportive. Apple -FAIl

I have been a loyal apple customer for years. I own a Macbook Pro, an iMac all one and 5 different iPhones from me down to my 5 children. So 5 days ago my iphone X went out and I could not update it or restore it. I made an appointment with the Apple Store in Northbrook the guy tried to do the same things I did at home and was getting the same error message that I got. I was t then told that the logic board went out and it would cost me $ 549.00 to replace the phone or if I was eligible for an upgrade I could do that.He said my warranty  had expired just 42 days ago. I told the guy I had no plans to upgrade and that he could see my phone was spotless and in excellent condition.  I then called 1-800-MY-APPLE to see if they would replace my phone being that the warranty just expired a little over 30 days ago so you guessed it they refused to replace the phone. Apple is a freaking JOKE and a RIP off. This is their way to force people to upgrade to their new products. Well guess what I refuse to remain loyal to a company that could care less about us. I am going to Team ANDROID!

Always very high quality and professional products in stock, which can bid on something. I was surprised by the image quality as it is better than described in most reviews. I have both iPhone and Apple Watch and can only recommend both products because they also deliver good for the respective price.

Apple is a company that could be assimilate to a totalitarian government where they do whatever they want and decide whatever they want do with the services that actually after pay belong to us. It is like some sell you your house and suddenly put you out!!! Really we complain about governments but here have apple doing whatever they want. I quite buy anything from apple welcome the free android.  No waste time with apple wish the company sink as they deserve. PD  the customer service have not fault the problem is as always the internal policy that this companies have, if they not follow they get fired!!

This company gets worse by the min.  If you cant unlock an email account which is basic help desk level support. You are worthless, absolutely worthless. You are not protecting anything when I can verify all the information around my account. You are doing nothing but showing extreme poor customer service. If you cant do one of the most basic IT tasks, I can only imagine the lack of knowledge when it comes to something more serious.  Not worth staying with apple products. I have 7 devices, all will be changed!! You lock an account for 24 hours? seriously this is ridiculous

Worst online shopping experience. After two hour sessions with customer service who gave me wrong information, told me things were resolved when they were not and wanted me to keep going out of my way to try to buy their product, I ended up just canceling my order. Disaster from a to z. I wanted to buy an iMac for my wife's birthday. Never buying anything from Apple again. How can an online purchase be made so difficult? It beggars believe.

One day,  Apple just stopped to update the software of my (older type) iphone.   I would accept that, but the  problem is, the  Apps for this Iphone type are now all removed from the APPSTORE.   Given,  they ONLY WAY to install app,  is via the APPSTORE, my  Iphone became virtually useless.  I can understand,  newer Apps may not work on older Iphones, and that is not the issue  here.    But I find it wrong,  the removed all older apps from the appstore.     If the writer of the Apps would remove them,  fair enough.  But it leaves a bad taste if Apple deletes simply all of them, and I have to buy a new IPhone for this reason.  The old one did what I needed.

I have a 2013 Mac book air and the screen just went black and I last used it last week. I call and am on the phone for damn near an hour troubleshooting shooting etc.. lady was Pleasant and helpful. She did tell me that my warranty had expired but that I could mail it in free of charge they will look at it and figure out what’s wrong with it then they’ll call me to let me know how much it would be then I would pay then they would return my MacBook Air. However we got disconnected at the end when I called back I got a  different person named Samantha Who wanted to help me troubleshoot again I let her know that I needed to just mail in the computer because the troubleshooting didn’t work with the last lady, she said that I might want to try that before I mailed it in because I already have a bill that it was in my emails and if I really wanted to have the box sent to me it was going to cost me almost $500 and then once they figure out what’s wrong with it if it’s more or less then the $500 they will either give you your money remaining back or charge you more before you could get it back! It is absolutely insane that we spent so much on these products, and then there is no support on getting them fixed I’m all about paying if my warranty is expired but $500 just to have it looked at is absolutely ridiculous. I will no longer be buying Apple products.It is absolutely insane that we spend so much on these products, and then there is no support on getting them fixed, I’m all about paying if my warranty is expired but $500 just to have it looked at is absolutely ridiculous.

I have a 2013 Mac book air and the screen just went black and I last used it last week. I call and am on the phone for damn near an hour troubleshooting shooting etc.. lady was Pleasant and helpful. She did tell me that my warranty had expired but that I could mail it in free of charge they will look at it and figure out whatâ€™s wrong with it then theyâ€™ll call me to let me know how much it would be then I would pay then they would return my MacBook Air. However we got disconnected at the end when I called back I got a  different person named Samantha Who wanted to help me troubleshoot again I let her know that I needed to just mail in the computer because the troubleshooting didnâ€™t work with the last lady, she said that I might want to try that before I mailed it in because I already have a bill that it was in my emails and if I really wanted to have the box sent to me it was going to cost me almost $500 and then once they figure out whatâ€™s wrong with it if itâ€™s more or less then the $500 they will either give you your money remaining back or charge you more before you could get it back! It is absolutely insane that we spent so much on these products, and then there is no support on getting them fixed Iâ€™m all about paying if my warranty is expired but $500 just to have it looked at is absolutely ridiculous. I will no longer be buying Apple products.It is absolutely insane that we spend so much on these products, and then there is no support on getting them fixed, Iâ€™m all about paying if my warranty is expired but $500 just to have it looked at is absolutely ridiculous.

Had been using my Mini I pad for 5yrs with no problems logging in with PIN Number . With my Hotmail Email address. I went to use it the other day and it has an Activation lock on it by Apple . Spent 2 hours on the phone with them and they kept saying You have to log in with your G Mail address and Password. Told them I have NEVER had a G Mail address. Have had the same Hotmail for the past 20yrs which  was on their System . They refuse to unlock my I Pad as it may be stolen ,even though I have the Original Box it came in from Big W. Cant find the receipt .So They have made My I Pad useless.In the Garbage bin . Will NEVER buy another Apple Product. It seems they can Lock your I Pad any time they want, without warning, if it hasnt been used for 3 weeks, they mark it down as possible Missing or stolen ???. Treat everybody as a thief.

The store + phone lines, customer service is atrocious. They blame each other if there's an issue instead of helping you and sorting it out.  No marked point or desk in store where you can get help, unhelpful staff.   I had an appointment at the Aberdeen store in the UK. I arrived in plenty of time. I took both my ipad and phone down to be looked at.  No one was their to help so I sat at the back and waited for a very long time trying to get help.  I began to feel ill due to the heat and the person sitting next to me agreed it was far to warm. He looked ill/tired because of the heat as well and had also been waiting a long time. I asked someone if i could get some cold water as I felt ill. Was told no and directed to Boots which turned out to be much cooler.  I went to buy some water and went outside to cool down as well. It was cool outside.  When i came back there was someone in with a tablet talking to someone. It wasn't  until i spoke to them that i was told you don't sit at the back of the store. I was not advised when i made the appointment, over the phone that they have this idiotic system.  When I was getting up to go outside feeling ill, dizzy, nauseous i knocked my ipad onto the floor , obviously the screen bloody broke.  When i was being helped with my phone i over heard i presume the male boss talking to a female manager talking about why no one had been at the front helping. Turns out someone was off and they where very busy.  I couldn't wait to get out of the store as id been there for about an hour, so  I complained about the long wait, over the phone which made me feel ill and the damage to my ipad but was fobbed off by the store and phone line service.

Went to Apple Westfield Stratford City to replace the left airpod for my Airpods Pro at their Genius Bar. Lady who served me did not seem like she knew what she was doing, didnt even look to see what was the problem and replaced the airpod right away. However, i was told to wait 20 minutes for it to charge and then again 40 minutes for the new left airpod to pair with the right existing airpod. I said Im not going to wait 40 minutes and she just left. No goodbye. I felt this was unprofessional and reported to the manager. He seemed to let on that there is nothing wrong with this behaviour and asked me what I would like him to do about it. Properly train your staff mate, its not my problem but yours for losing customers this way and making a bad rep for the company.

Quite possibly the worst support I have ever received. After receiving several prompts from my iMac I updated the OS to Catalina. After the install none of my Adobe Creative Suite would work so I called Apple support to see if there was a fix. They suggested reverting to an older OS such as mojave and then talked me through the process, which to cut a long story short has resulted in an iMac that now has corrupt firmware that means it cannot find the Macintosh HD drive and the computer no longer works. Apple support have arranged to collect the iMac and repair it but this will take a week and even after explaining that I do stock/share trading and this could cost me a lot of money they offered no alternative and said that as my system is out of warranty they will not accept responsibility. F u apple!   I sold my iPhone, iPad and MacBook last year and switched to Android because I strongly disagree Apples business practices and pricing that they have implemented over the past couple of years. Looks like my iMac will be going next.

Just had a bad experience with Apple customer service, My Charger blew up, went with a pop. Does not work anymore, did the usual checks with apple service live chat and confirmed laptop is all ok, so I asked if I am still under warranty, I had to do all the work to find out even though they had my serial number (can't get into chat without it) he would not help me and asked me to take my laptop to a shop which is miles away, would take me a morning to get there and back, we already confirmed it was the charger that is broken so what is the issue of sending me a replacement? Instead I have to wait for a few days for somebody to have a look at my broken charger, and longer multiple trips no doubt when buying a new charger for an extortionate price will work out cheaper in the end while getting me up and running the same day, it's done on purpose. And there is no customer service whatsoever. if they can't even be bothered to honour their warranty which I should be covered for, I am definitely not going to be buying mac again. For the sake of that charger you can expect to lose out on many thousands of pounds worth of purchases from me.

Service for apple care is absolutely terrible. I had my phone stolen and the only way to submit a claim is to get a verification code that is sent to your phone...which is the thing you're trying to replace. They do literally nothing at all to help you, they told me to wait 7 business days to get a friend’s phone number approved to get a verification code on it just to start the claim process. The employees do nothing to help. In store employees tell you to call apple support, apple support says they can't do anything until you get a code. Totally terrible experience, not designed with the consumer in mind what so ever. Simply made to encourage you to buy an additional apple product. Would not recommend. Apple has lost their way since Cook took over.

Purchased a Apple 11 (what a mug). It really isn’t anything special, place it next to the latest Samsung and it looks almost Bronze Age. Bulky, heavy. Camera and battery life and fast charge are amazing.      Downside is, they want money for absolutely everything. Casting to my tv with Android (FREE) casting to my tv with iPhone, cheapest available option £34.99 (that’s for life though) Really Apple, so generous....FOR LIFE!     My iPhone 11 Pro Max on EBay next few days. Apple your so greedy, and it ain’t pretty. S Jobs was the Apple innovator, and he was truly a genius who brought us the iMac, MacBook, iPhone to name but a few.    Great reviews Apple. The bigger the giant, the harder they fall. It happened to Microsoft and it will happen to Apple.    Reality check: iPhones are made in China.

I am so mad I could scream!  I have a phone with a broken back. I am told that because it is the back that is broke, I should go through Apple. It was easy enough, I called, new phone shipped and I would send old one back. I try to use new phone for 3 days and LUCKILY I had not sent my broken phone back because the new one that was sent to me DID NOT WORK! Several calls later explaining that phone sent as replacement does not work and where is my replacement? Go ahead and sent new/not working one back, we’ll take care of you. Apparently the gal that I talked to gave me bad information and I have to start a new case because the other one was cancelled, I don’t know how since I never got a working phone! WHAT?? I would go to an Apple store but the closest one is 2 hours away!  I think I need an Android....

I have literally spent my entire Saturday on the phone with apple.com to get refunded for charges on my credit card that I DID not authorize!!  I authorized a 1 time $.99 transaction and apparently Apple just keeps your credit card on file so the user can continue to buy things when they want. Mind you it's an 11 year olds phone. I was treated good by the rep, but when the supervisor Heather got on the phone she was very rude and condescending I asked to speak with her supervisor and she flat out told me no and proceeded to hang up on me!!  This is why I myself will never own an iphone.  Only reason my kids have them is because someone else purchased them. That big of a company and that's the best you can do?  Unreal!!! I urge anyone that has a child with an iPhone to NEVER buy anything off apple.com. I guess anyway they can make a dollar.

I've been an Apple customer for over 22 years. I own three iPhones and seven Macintosh computers. I used to be a loyal and proud Apple consumer. The beginning of the end for Apple products quality and customer service began when Steve Jobs' illness left him unable to lead his company the way he originally did since Apple’s inception.  Now, Apple's customer service and product quality is as bad as Microsoft. Apple always wanted parity with Microsuck, and now Apple's finally gotten its wish.  In my most recent case, Apple's AirPod product never achieves its advertised talk time. I replaced the first generation AirPods I purchased because they were conking out well before their advertised talk time. After the replacement pair fared no better, I decided to pay the increase in price for the AirPod 2nd generation. Big mistake. The extra money I spent didn't buy me Apple's claimed talk time. I replaced the 2nd generation AirPods three times under warranty. The problem continued. Since I could no longer receive a refund on my original purchase, I requested that Apple permit me to exchange my AirPod 2's for the Airpod Pro. I was more than willing to pay the cost difference. Apple refused. All I could do is keep returning the AirPods until my original warranty expired. Apple sent me a complimentary new pair of 2nd Generation Airpods. I appreciated the gesture but it would have made more dollars and sense if Apple had just permitted me to pay for an upgrade and return the malfunctioning AirPods product. The most current AirPods I have still do not function as advertised.   Thankfully, I have an extended warranty from my credit card company. I am hoping its worth the time and trouble I took to file a claim. I’ve been told by a representative from my credit card company that AirPod claims are quite commonplace. I am not surprised. Advice to others reading this: Never purchase an Apple product unless you use a credit card with an extended warranty program.  When you call Apple Tech Support or Apple Customer Service be prepared to have a significant portion of your precious time wasted. I lost track of how many dozens of hours I have spent with Apple over the last 10 months, attempting to seek a remedy. You are likely to spend hours and hours on the phone, first with a line representative, and then with a “customer relations” employee. It is highly likely that Apple will lead you down the primrose path. After soft-soaping you for an hour or two on the phone, Apple will inevitably leave you hanging. If you want to start the complaint process all over again with a new Apple customer service employee, expect to have more of your time wasted and more empty promises.  And if you think you’re going to find more understanding and helpfulness at your local Apple Store, think again. They are as ineffectual, apathetic, and complacent as Apple’s phone support.  I’m in the market for a new computer. Before I go out and spend another $2500 on an Apple computer product I am going to remember all the trouble and bad service I’ve received on my $199.00 AirPods.  If Apple doesn’t take care of their customers somebody else will.

I've been an Apple customer for over 22 years. I own three iPhones and seven Macintosh computers. I used to be a loyal and proud Apple consumer.

For two years the iCloud service has been broken for me. It's a server side issue that a number of people at the customer support and technical staff have been trying to sort out. But they all fail and they almost never call back on agreed dates and times.  Since Apple refuses to refund my hardware I have no started a legal process against the company.

You can ONLY be refunded for 2 months worth of Apple Music charges. Even when you have been charged for OVER A YEAR and HAVE NOT USED IT ONCE.  This is blowing my mind, i have been charged almost $200 and the ""supervisor"" I was directed to after the original associate on the call could NOT give me any more than the 2 months the first person gave me back. This is unacceptable. I will consider going to Android.

This review is for Apple Shopping Experience, not for an Apple Product.  Boy, am I disappointed with Apple. I ordered an iMac, FedEx attempted to deliver it today (Thursday), no one was home. I tried to have this held at FedEx so that I can pick it up tomorrow, negative says FedEx, Apple has restrictions on the delivery.  I got in touch with Apple, they said that this is the way it is. So, tomorrow Friday FedEx will try a new delivery, the attempt will be futile because there won't be anybody at home. You see, I work and I can't take an entire day sitting home while I wait for the FedEx truck.  If they would at least five me a time frame, then maybe I can work with that. So, Saturday they will try again, and guess what, I will not be home either. Basically Apple told me that FedEx has to make several delivery attempts before a ""hold-the-item-at-a-FedEx-location"" will kick into effect. That they said will be sometime next week.  So, you can understand how disappointed I am while the FedEx truck roams around town with my iMac that I wont be able to see for several days. I told the Apple representative that I was really frustrated by the situation, and that I felt extremely deceived by Apple for not advising customers of this kind of scenario.  I guess the Apple promise of FREE delivery is, well, delivery will take place sometime in the future.   Ricardo Arambarri Order # W952094471

Apple have no complaints department and clearly don’t care. When googling saw an article saying Apple removed all their negative reviews.  It is also a myth that android is a lot harder to use from someone who’s not tech savvy

Apple Mac OS Catalina is dreadful 1. URLs don't render quickly if at all - so have to now use Google Chrome 2. Search Function for emails does't operate - for example, where I know I have say 20 emails for a particular address, one or none now appear, so an inoperable function 3. Banking Apps don't work on Safari, so have to use Google Chrome 4. Uploading say videos to Facebook, has to be done twice for upload to complete fully  Noticed over last two years, the Apple Operating System is less and less smooth and functions are becoming very clunk, click  If I had to upgrade, I would have to reconsider whether apple is right, which is a shame.  Noticing reviews are getting worse. So many people feeling this, And when I speak to others, they are noticing same so only a matter of time before this becomes wide-spread knowledge and reaches a critical mass... please Apple start getting back to creating great aesthetically functioning products again

Well January 17 my lockout!! I had got so use to using Touch ID that once my phone went dead I was stuck I couldn’t even remember the password. So I to contact apple support by phone was told to follow steps to recovery on top of that I had no idea what my Apple ID password was once again to use to using Touch ID. Long story short apple security is the best I must say that. I had so many steps to do, just to be able to get into my iphone. Thank God for iCloud for much was saved!  I called apple once on the 17 and all other contact was email the iTunes recovery steps didn’t seem simple at 1st however once I plugged her up to a desktop it was all she wrote today is the 21 my phone is backup and running. I say that was pretty good being the error codes I was getting was right there on the support site. So I knew it was my computer or wire. Today I called in for once I was able to get into my phone I ended up getting stuck the rep was able to help me and I’m now looking at my children’s videos&amp; pictures I had backed up thanking all  representatives who helped me.

I have been using mobile phones more than 20 years. Apple products are the only one I have had issues with. My main concern is the poor quality of the products although I could talk hours of the poorly designed interface and touchscreen.  Latest incident happened with the Ipad charger as it started smoking during Ipad charging and nearly ignited our curtains. I contacted customer support - which is by the way really difficult to find correct channel to complain - and as the guarantee was expired couple months ago they bluntly said that no reimbursements and have a good day. Needless to say that we only use original products but in Apple case it really doesn't matter if we would use some cheap China version.

If I could give apple a Minus star I would and that would be -100 star rating. Anyone thinking to buy an apple mobile phone DO NOT stay well clear of this company. You buy a phone out of your money this company thinks and acts as though they still own it.BUY A SAMSUNG mobile phone - far better company to use. Whilst away out of the country my apple mobile would not allow me to link into any free wifi spots including the hotel I stayed in and also a portable wifi device. But my partner has a Samsung - no problems what soever. Apple has to respect the OWNERS of mobile phones and NOT think that they still own it as THEY DO !!!!

Do not attempt to trade in your iPhone by mail!!!  When purchasing a new iPhone I decided that trading in my old iPhone would be easier than trying to sell it myself.  Because I don't live anywhere close to an Apple store I mailed in my iPhone for trade in.  My 6S+ spent it's entire life in a protective case with an additional glass screen saver on it.  It was in perfect condition and could have been sold or given away and made someone very happy.  I mailed it in using the provided packaging materials; however, once it got to Apple's third party trade in partner, it magically had a bad screen that didn't work correctly.  Supposedly dead pixels and wavy lines.  Now, that could have happened during mailing but is that my fault?  They want to keep my phone and give me nothing.  Baloney!  This is a total scam and I warn you not to fall for their ""easy"" trade in line!!!!

The phone actually rang for 22 minutes, 15 minutes the 16 minutes (yes we called back 3 times) and no on even answered the damn phone. YEP...never even answered.  The support people who tried to help us (wherever they are located) said they tried to call as well (and they work for this stupid Apple company).  Then they tried to call and said it even rang non-stop and couldn't get through.

All I asked for was an exchange and the customer service agent Eto Kharanauli was rude and mocking telling me I should have noticed straight away and that they only do 14 days return even in the case of Christmas time.  I could understand if I was asking for a refund but an exchange costs them nothing. Will not purchase Apple again. If this is what they are like for a £58 order imagine what they email be like for more expensive items.

I got a brand new sealed iPhone XS and lid extra for the FUNNY Apple care which I didnâ€™t know itâ€™s just a joke but my brand new phone has Face ID issue and Apple said we just replace the phone and not with a new sealed one, also we had this appointment in the Montgomery mall Bethesda Maryland and also talked with the manager who was a very rude person and got very bad attitude I am so sorry for Apple, donâ€™t waste your money for this brand. And I forgot to tell that my wife and I collect money to buy this iPhone as a gift for a poor person who had cancer maybe we could make him happy. So angry and so sorry for Apple who doesnâ€™t care customers.

Just bought a new bundle deal which included an iPod.  They locked my business acct and the only way to unlock it is to buy an Apple Card and give code and then they will refund your money.  This is a crock they canâ€™t even unlock you acct with out you spending money..

If I could give them zero stars I would. My iPhone X that was only a year and a half old with no prior issues and suddenly got so hot it was burning my hands and ear when I tried to make a 1 minute phone call and then just stopped charging and only occasionally turned on. I called Apple to see what they could do about it and they said my only option was a nearly $700 repair. A $700 repair due to something completely out of my control. Not to mention I spent about 2 hours on the phone with them, most of it being on hold. I have had iPhones my entire life but after this I will never buy another apple product again. I refuse to pay money for a phone that is going to essentially just self destruct after a year.

Called customer service due to problems backing up on iCloud on iPhone and missing photos on my Mac and phone during backup attempt. After 7+ hours of going from one specialist to another and being to call back nothing has been resolved. And to make matters worse the last “senior” specialist I spoke to named Macy he became angry at my frustration to not want to repeat the same process he went on to hang up on me. I asked to speak to someone abobe him but he refused. I have always loved Apple products as I have 10 of their products. Needless to say I’m beyond disappointed in the poor customer service that Apple offers their customers. After this experience I have very little if any interest to continue to being an Apple customer.

I was a life long fan of Mac's, Iphones and everything to do with Apple. Now I find myself not buying  their products for two simple reason's. Their products no longer justify the premium cost and the backup has significantly dropped in recent years.  I'm switching everything to Samsung as I retire my Apple products over time. Recently I was in the convent garden shop and the Genius assistant tried to sell me a new battery for £49 pounds to replace a dead battery in a 14 month old iphone. No battery replacement as the battery is now considered a consumable component. Two major problems here. A. All Apple products including Iphones are sealed products, there's nothing you can replace on them, there's no consumables! its one sealed product. £49 to replace a battery a Samsung user can replace for £8. B. When I pointed this out and mentioned I would put the £49 towards a Samsung at half the price for the same spec, the Apple shop assistant looked at me as if I was a fool. You really need to take that type of reaction personally and give your money to another brand.  Hope this helps.

I am not happy with the iCloud tiers, my phone is having a 256 GB, but the tier is at 200 Gb, making me pay $8 if I go above 200.  Why are the iCloud tiers not aligned with the phone capacities?

Disgusting service. Need to security check their staff better!!!! If there was an option for no stars that would be my choice! Had my I phone 11 for just about 6 weeks and it kept switching off and back on my network could not help and I spoke to Apple who asked me to return the phone for repair. They sent me the “tamper proof” packaging to return the phone in. I followed the instructions and sealed the bag, it was then checked at the post office before posting and I watched it go in the post bag. I had heard nothing for a couple of weeks so got in touch with Apple and they informed me that the package had reached them empty and had not been tampered with upon receipt. I explained I had proof of posting, I had the weight of the parcel on the receipt showing it was not empty but they refused to accept it as proof I sent the phone back to them. I on the other hand am expected to take the word of an advisor that the person who opened the package was telling the truth and the package was empty despite my watching it go with my own eyes into the post bag with the phone inside! They cannot check any security footage to provide me with proof it was empty on receipt nor can they replace my phone as their staff recorded it on their system as empty!! Absolutely shocking customer service from a global company who have thousands of pounds of goods going through the depot but no means of checking security of customers goods is paramount 😡

I on November 22nd 2019 purchased iphone 11 pro max mobile, I found auto restart issue. Later I went to icare service center so they restored the device and gave back saying everything fixed and the very next day same thing continued again I visited service center, they kept my mobile for observation about 24 hrs they denied my complaint by saying no problem with device, gave me report stating all tests passed and told me to take a video if it gets restarts so that there will be proof (sounds very funny because I wont be holding my mob whenever it gets restarts) they also told me to contact iphone customer care they might help.... I followed, I explained the issue with customer care people they took nearly a week and said there is an ""hardware issue found in your device as per their internal team report"" so goto service center, I took an appointment by 3PM customer care girl told me that she will give me call same and tell service center people about the issue, at exactly 3PM she called me and disconnected immediately I don't know why, I was waiting at service center by that time hoping that she will call again but I got an email saying ""we tried calling you were unable to respond so we will call you in 24hrs"" I was surprised by the service by both service center and customer care, I was waiting in service center so i again called customer care and new person again I explained everything happened by this it was already4pm, she told that she will explain about the hardware issue to service center girl. Once I gave call to service center girl I don't know she disconnected what the hell was going on!!!!! again I contacted new customer care person same repeats..... service center guys just wanted a email confirmation about the hardware issue as they did not find it.. but they denied saying they can't send email but orally they can say, but these fellows told customer care people are giving fake promises we can't help at the end time was almost 6pm!!!!! I gave device there and they kept for observation I didn't understand what's the point of keeping my device for observation as they already got to know that there is an hardware issue?? I gave and showed the so called proof video of device getting restart and few pics reports... after 4 days they called me and told there is no problem with device I don't understand how these people making me fool and roam around these days it's so evident that there is problem with device but one will say there is hardware issue another says no your device is perfect I'm facing this issue I invested my money on defected piece and for that this is the response I get great I had lot of expectations but these people!!!!!! It's new phone and these issues and response freaking!!! Instead of replacing my phone they are making me fool!!!

However this week Belkin announced that they are shutting down the service that supports them and bricking both cameras in a months time.   So I have 2 working items that will be bricked in a month. I have a security device that will be inoperable in a month and no way of  changing it due to lockdown. I have a property I will be unable to monitor in a months time leaving it unprotected. And I will have to fork out money I do not have due to no income during lockdown to replace the service after lockdown,  And this is all with only 1 months warning, when nothing previously informed to me or advertised on their product  gave warning that this could happen.  The one thing I can say is that when looking at a replacement service, Belkin will be excluded from even being considered. I can also say that I will never buy another Belkin product in my life.  But if you want to buy goods from a company which is willing with only 1 months notice to brick something you purchased during a worldwide pandemic when that item is actually needed but can't be replaced because of legal restrictions put in place by your government, feel free to buy from them.

                Make no mistake, this is a great coffee maker. The ability of choose your own settings, flow rate, bloom time, water temp, all make for a great cup of coffee. But for $300, I would think they've worked out the mechanical kinks. We've already sent our thermal brew pot back once, because of coffee leaking down the machine and pooling on the counter. The new one has a similar problem, and coffee pools under the pot. We are constantly mopping up drips and trails of coffee. Love the brew, not thrilled with the machine.

                Please be wary if you choose this brand, I had a Breville espresso machine that short circuited, it was two and a half years old and well maintained. I rang Breville who organised for me to take the machine to a nearby repairer. The repairer soon contacted me to tell me that there was a leaky seal and that it was a manufacturing fault rather than a ware and tear issue.  The cost to repair would be $320. This would turn out to be the second repair to this machine, the first repair cost me $164. I rang Breville to see if there was any chance they would replace the machine or at least cover the cost of the repair especially considering the machine history. I was told the issue would be investigated and I would receive a phone call back in a day or two. After eight days and no phone call, I rang them back. Clearly the issue had not been investigated so the lady that took my call promised me she would follow this up and ring me back the following morning.  To her credit, she rang back and told me that as the machine 12 month warranty had run out it was a ware and tear issue (not what I was told by the repairer) and that none of the cost would be worn by breville, nor would I receive a replacement machine, in other words, as soon as the warranty had run out, they didn't want to know about it! I nearly fell over!!   Being a business owner myself this is a classic case of poor customer service, I have been a loyal brand (Breville) consumer for a number of years but poor service is something I simply will not tolerate. Had Breville agreed to help me this review would be favourable rather than negative! I remain thoroughly disappointed rather than angry. Needless to say, I will not be buying this brand again.......

                Breville will not sell internal parts at all. They will only accept the entire unit back for servicing at a ridiculously high flat rate of &gt;50% of  new unit price. Shame on them for contributing to landfill junk.

                Do not waste your money! I purchased the Breville milk frother. The first time I used the product it surpassed all expectations, producing an abundant froth more like whipped cream. I was impressed. After 2 months, and having used the milk frother less than 15 times, it stopped working. I had a very expensive appliance to warm milk. I called customer support and was instructed where to return my frother. I received the replacement quickly. I tried it immediately with great results, but alas, after about 2 months, the frother once again produces only warm milk!

                Bought a breville cafe milk frother in late 2017 from David’s tea for a Christmas gift for myself, because why not treat myself? The insurance cheque had just cleared after the beast (total loss). Anyway, the milk frother stopped working today so I called breville expecting some reasonable troubleshooting tips or perhaps them to offer 30-40% off a new machine since this one was in pristine condition externally but had shhht the bed. Instead, the lady on the phone tells me if I don’t have the receipt there is nothing further they can do. I can pay 99$ for a repair—but that doesn’t give any warranty. It’s on sale at the bay for 129$ with shipping right now. She said based on my machines serial number I could have owned it since 2011. That’s insane. It was likely manufactured then, and in a warehouse, then sitting in a store for a while before I bought it. I lost everything in a fire that devastated my community. Does this “lady” really think I escaped with a milk frother and this is some conspiracy? What is she smoking?!?! I have a variable temperature breville kettle, and a handheld mixer and they’re both breville products. I’ll be selling this garbage and buying smeg, kitchen aid or something else.

                A toaster has only one purpose - to toast bread.  I am sorry I wasted my money on the Breville (the bit More) 2-slice toaster.  One has to turn it almost to it's highest setting to get a good browning.  To make matters worse, it hardly toasts the second side of the same slice!  This is not a cheap toaster, it's performance is lousy.  I highly recommend NOT buying it.

                I sent in my Breville juicer for repairs on 3 November. Finally, after much fighting and people not getting back to me, I found out on 19 December that there is a spare part that needs to come from Australia but no one knows when I can get my machine back, despite multiple promises about how the process would work. In fact, I was supposed to get my machine back last week. Suddenly I find out this new information that no one told me for weeks.  This is the first Breville product I owned, and I was happy with it and had a positive view of Breville. That started to change when I was looking at buying their Peel and Dice food processor and sent an e-mail asking about the myriad problems I had read about, the reply to which was essentially ""If it doesn't make customers happy, it's okay because we like it"". Now this experience with getting my only Breville product repaired has sealed the deal. I will not touch another Breville product again and I will also stay away from all of the companies in the Foschini Group, including the @Home stores, as they are part of this very negative experience.

While the offer the part on their website at the cost of $2.99 (which is fine) - I had guests coming into town for the holidays and couldn't wait that long.  So for a high-end machine and (in theory) company: - They need to go the extra mile in customer service (also not take 6.5hrs to call people back) - They need to make plastics that aren't so fragile that they break so soon and so easily. - They need to offer expedited shipping options to their customers (that's eCommerce 101 stuff).

                Breville support is non existent.  We bought the barista express and the pressure gauge will not increase. My husband has tried for a week to get in touch.  The support number says you can elect to get a call back, but it does not provide a means to indicate you want a call back. Then it tells you there are a high volume of calls and just hangs up on you.   My husband is returning the machine today.

While the offer the part on their website at the cost of $2.99 (which is fine) - I had guests coming into town for the holidays and couldn't wait that long.  So for a high-end machine and (in theory) company: - They need to go the extra mile in customer service (also not take 6.5hrs to call people back) - They need to make plastics that aren't so fragile that they break so soon and so easily. - They need to offer expedited shipping options to their customers (that's eCommerce 101 stuff).

                IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I MOST CERTAINLY WOULD.  I HAVE LOOKED AT ALL THE HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SUPPORT COMPLAINTS.  AND NOW I AM ONE MORE.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BEYOND HORRIBLE.  THEY NEED TO BE UTTERLY ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.  STARTED TO CALL AT 8AM.  WAITED 1HR AND 15 MINUTES ON HOLD BEFORE I HUNG UP.  REALLY REALLY BAD.  THEN CALLED ONCE MORE AND WAS PUT IN THE ETERNAL LINE OF ENTERING YOUR NUMBER.  WAITED,....GET THIS......4 HOURS.AND GOT ONE RING AND THE LINE WENT DEAD.  SO ALL OVER AGAIN.  THEN AGAIN.  NOW I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1 1/2 HOURS AND THEY NEED TO GO GET STUFFED AS I AM SO DISGUSTED WITH BREVILLE AND THEIR COMPLETE LACK OF  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  PATHETIC REALLY.  I HAVE 6 BREVILLE PRODUCTS.  NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.  ITS A......TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN COMPANY.  THEY ABSOLUTELY DESERVE THE HORRENDOUS RATING THEY HAVE EARNED AND ACHIEVED. SO NOW I AM TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE AS MANY BAD REVIEWS AS POSSIBLE.  IT'S WORTH MY WASTED TIME.

                Breville support is non existent.  We bought the barista express and the pressure gauge will not increase. My husband has tried for a week to get in touch.  The support number says you can elect to get a call back, but it does not provide a means to indicate you want a call back. Then it tells you there are a high volume of calls and just hangs up on you.   My husband is returning the machine today.

                Freaking aweful service! I just purchased this after black friday. Straight out of the box the pressure pin will not even climb. It is suppose to at least reach the center and it doesnt do anything. The crema is not even coming out. Called the support like and it actually tells me they are experiencing higher then normal call times and tells me to call back another time then hangs up the phone on me. This is day 2 of trying to contact them. Guess who is returning this and going with a different company, me. I do not have time to waste on a crap company like this. I will take my $500 somewhere else.

                Contacting any type of Breville  support is a nightmare!!! I am in Canada and the support center is in Quebec and if Breville cares about their image they should change service providers. Where are these people, In the North Pole or perhaps the Moon? I made an experiment on waiting for someone to pick the phone call, by the way there is no other way for contact, for 2.5 hours until my phone battery died with no success :) Do not ever consider the option of providing your phone number so they supposedly keep your place on the line. Ha, what a joke, I did it twice and was sent in the twilight zone indefinitely. The joke is on us however, the customers. I only need a replacement for my double shot pressurized basket for my brand new Breville Barista Pro where it just happened the included one is clogged and not working at all. I am ready to buy myself a new one but can't find it anywhere. I pray I do not need them for anything in the future and so much in the beginning with my Breville's family membership I already doubt my next purchase will have that same logo on it. Sooooo Sad..

                I sincerely don't know what what these people are actually complianing about. While on hold to get my new Breville espresso cappuccino machine figure it out I read all these horrible reviews on the customer service provided by this company. This is absolutely NOT true. My waiting time was 50 minutes and the customer service that I received from the lady that the people are complaining about was absolutely outstanding. She was able to help me for like half an hour and remained very polite and professional through the whole process while guiding me to correct my machine. I am sincerely so grateful and happy that this lady helped me solve my issue as the cappuccino espresso machine that I was fixing, I had bought in for a friend. This review is coming right from the heart and is exactly my experience. Don't believe everything you read

                Breville customer service very very bad. The lady answering  my call not very nice in giving answers or listening to a customer and she promised to send me an email with an offering price which is not the best deal about a dicing kit.She never sent the email.Besides, I called since I bought the Breville 16 cup peel and dice food processor; the box displays the different dicing kit but it is not part of the contents in the box but instead I found a piece of paper saying I can get a free dicing kit, limited time and first register the product.I registered the food processor I bought and I was expecting to get instructions to get this free dicing kit, but nothing happened. That was my reason I called to customer service. The lady said it is an old offer and they do not offer it anymore.I try to explain if something is displayed outside of the box ,customers expect to see those contents inside of the box and because this was not the situation...for sure this is a false display making customers believe they are paying for something that it really doesn’t come in the box...I am very disappointed knowing customer service is the worst experience I have faced. When I called they never answered the phone and even if you send a case...event though it mentions you will get an answer soon...that never happened to me.  I am very disappointed Breville does  not have a good customer service and it seems they do not care about customers.Because of this I feel next time I will not buy any other product from them...unless they make sure customer service can be a good support to all it’s clients.

                Worst possible customer service.  They supposedly will call you back when you type in your telephone number but on now FOUR separate occasions they have not returned the call.  I had to return a spendy product (combo grinder and coffee maker) and when I inquired into the status the cookie-cutter response was ""your order is being carefully packed.""  Awful company.  Plus, the product worked fine for a month then stopped working at least twice a week -- I had to manually go in and chip away coffee build-up.  Understandable to do it every few months or so, but twice a year?  Save yourself the grief and don't buy from this company

                Bought a new espresso machine, Barista Express. The machine was unusable out of the box as it was unable to produce the pressure to pull a decent shot. Contacted Breville right away and was told that ""the pressure doesn't simply stop working..."" and that the issues must be either old coffee beans or my inability to grind the coffee correctly. I was sent a youtube link to perform a pressure test, which I did, and which the machine failed. I let Breville know the outcome of the pressure test, twice, and sent a video demonstrating the test and its results. I requested instructions on how to return/exchange the machine and have never heard from this company again...absolutely appalling! In the meantime I also discovered that after filling the water tank, the water somehow leaks into the tray...I had filled the tank to prime the machine and after a while realized that the water was getting lower in the tank without having used the machine...I don't even know how that is possible. I let Breville know that as well and still, no answer...I'll do everything I can to never buy another Breville product!

I called breville and their service was great and sent me a new one. Well it worked great for a month. Now its back to doing the same thing it did when i returned it.

                Beware of using the Breville Pizzaiola Oven on quartz countertops.   I learned the hard way, and now my gorgeous, pristine white counter has an 8"" crack. The oven operates at a very high heat. No indication in the manual that this could be an issue. First time I ran it, I heard a very loud crack, and thought the stone broke. But once it cooled down and I check, the stone was fine and I was perplexed. I used it again on New Years Eve, and when I went to clean up I found the crack right in front of the oven. It appears the heat that emanates when the door is opened caused the crack and the first time, it began underneath and then surfaced upon the second use.   I contacted Breville and while they are very nice, they refused to acknowledge this could be an issue. I did research after the fact, and it seems quartz can withstand heat of up to 150°F. While I have always loved Breville products, this lack of concern for their customers is very disappointing.   I love the oven and have purchased some heat resistant mats to set it upon, which I told Breville they should ship with the oven. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I see that crack, and makes me feel very bad about the Breville organization.

                The toaster oven w air fry is not an easy thing to clean.  I spend much time trying to keep it looking ok but getting fed up.  I also after purchasing this unit and setting the item up to where i wanted it and giving my other toaster oven to a friend read the booklet to find out this carries a COULD CAUSE CANCER WARNING.   I tried to get info on this from the company.  Was given the run around so i joined the FaceBook group for this item.  Well, after posting a web site that showed that non stick surfaces do cause cancers,...I than was banned from posting for awhile on that site since others were agreeing.  The company is now saying it is the cord but I know better and they have not showed any proof to back it up.  They make is sound like it is just in California where you can get cancer.  What planet do they live on?  When a company is not honest about the product then it is time to start spending your money else where.

I added a Lower tray for dual printing on today 1/24/2020. It didn't work as it wouldn't communicate with the laptop/printer. I called Brother customer service and got ""Billy"" on the phone. This was at 10:53 am. He took me thru all kinds of trial and error which none of them worked. He then said he would like to talk with someone to get more information and would like to call me back. That was after he guessed at what to do for 38mins and 54 secs. He did call me back at 11:38am and spent another 31mins and 25secs deleting printers and reinstalling drives etc etc. I was getting upset for something he should have know to do that should only take 10-15mins. He couldn't figure it out. Then he said that he would pass it on up and have someone call me back. I asked when and he said by the end of the day!! Well it's now 4:35 pm and no return call. Thank goodness I have a Geek Squad account and I called them as soon as i hung up from Brother. They fixed the issue in 10 minutes. Brother should be totally ashamed of their tech services dept.

When these are answered I am sent to options to try page, all of which I have tried repeatedly.  I answer ""not helpful"" to be sent to the beginning without any option for an alternative, even slightly more effective one. Even tho I have been loath to try Brother for bad experience in earlier years, I decided to give it another shot as I know that there products have improved.

                I wish I hadn't bought the Brother DCP 1510 printer.  I bought it because of price, although it wasn't the very cheapest, and because I wanted a mono printer.  I was tired of buying 4 colours of expensive ink when I nearly always printed in black and white. It does print, I'll give it that, but the only interface is through buttons on the machine itself and a TINY LCD SCREEN which is ALMOST UNREADABLE.  There is no interface through whatever device you're using.  This is EXTREMELY ANNOYING.  Do not buy this machine unless you like frustration.

                I bought a Brother Scan N Cut just under 2 years ago, suddenly it developed a fault, I emailed the company and had a reply back within 12 hours, Jonathon was brilliant! He said it needed to come in and be checked over, I asked if it would cost me, he said they would do free of charge as they offered a TWO YEAR parts and warranty service!!! They collected the machine free, when I wanted it collected, it was gone barely 2 days and I received a message to say it was on its way back all better!!! They replaced parts, cleaned it and even when it came back with a missing stylus, no problem, Jonathon again on the case and popped a new one in the post - job done!!! What a fab company to deal with - people are quick to criticise but not enough praise is given - well heres a 5* review for you Brother - you were the business!!! THANK YOU! Fab, quick, efficient and friendly customer service!!! Jonathon did you proud!

                Bought a Brother laser printer (DCP1610) in March,good price,worked well.Since buying it I moved to France.Printer stopped working, contacted Brother UK who said they have a 'europe wide warranty',but I'd need to bring it back to the UK or contact Brother France. Needless to say, Brother France response was 'not bought here, not interested', so warranty useless. More landfill. Just ordered a Samsung (HP) replacement which I should have bought first time around (they do offer a proper warranty)

                I'm not sure why these reviews are so long because I had a great customer service experience with Nikolai this morning. He picked up quickly, I was on hold less than five minutes and he professionally and competently troubleshot my issue. I was worried I would have to buy a new printer, we got a ton of use out of it in the 18 months we owned it, but thankfully Brother's customer service was able to resolve the issue to my full satisfaction and we are back up and running in less than one hour from a firmware failure to phone call to resolution.

                Absolutely the worst, incompetent service I have ever seen. I had purchased a new HL-L6200DW on 12/2/19 which is working fine. I added a Lower tray for dual printing on today 1/24/2020. It didn't work as it wouldn't communicate with the laptop/printer. I called Brother customer service and got ""Billy"" on the phone. This was at 10:53 am. He took me thru all kinds of trial and error which none of them worked. He then said he would like to talk with someone to get more information and would like to call me back. That was after he guessed at what to do for 38mins and 54 secs. He did call me back at 11:38am and spent another 31mins and 25secs deleting printers and reinstalling drives etc etc. I was getting upset for something he should have know to do that should only take 10-15mins. He couldn't figure it out. Then he said that he would pass it on up and have someone call me back. I asked when and he said by the end of the day!! Well it's now 4:35 pm and no return call. Thank goodness I have a Geek Squad account and I called them as soon as i hung up from Brother. They fixed the issue in 10 minutes. Brother should be totally ashamed of their tech services dept. Why even have one? Pathetic!! I wasted over an hour with foolishness.

                Took forever to set up wireless.  The Brother ""support"" online could not be written more opaquely.  Seriously, instructions in hieroglyphics would have been just as helpful. Every single page comes out creased.  Every single page.  So bad that you could not send a letter printed on this machine.  I have tried to adjust the tray and troubleshoot per their instructions -- NOTHING WORKS.  This machine is worthless.

                I have spent the last several hours attempting to setup my Brother printer for the current location I am at;  my printer is offline and cannot see the network.   I finally exhorted to the ""brother support line"" to be bandied about between just answer; expecting that Brother can take the time to serve its customers, brother customer service which sends me repeatedly to some info on machine questions.  When these are answered I am sent to options to try page, all of which I have tried repeatedly.  I answer ""not helpful"" to be sent to the beginning without any option for an alternative, even slightly more effective one. Even tho I have been loath to try Brother for bad experience in earlier years, I decided to give it another shot as I know that there products have improved.   To this point, I have been extremely happy with the printer.   However, to not be able to get customer support for the unit, this gives me grave concern about my holdup when I have a serious issue under firm time constraints.  Lynda Barker

                The new Canon Pixima TS8150 which I was forced to buy because my older Canon printer (which was fine) needed something doing to it which the shop I use couldn't do as Canon had discontinued the software to allow them to repair it. (They were very apologetic).Just exactly how environmentally aware and responsible is that?! So this thing is a complete pain to use, completely un-user friendly, has all sorts of annoying ticks ( Do you want to retract the output tray? every time you turn it off!), the design is rubbish (whoever thought to put the swiveling info screen in a place so you can't see to feed a CD in nor the output tray either), why do I have to register the paper size every time I add paper? etc. etc....  And don't mention My Image Garden! Compared to the suite of facilities that used to exist, this is double-rubbish. You can only scan in PDF and JPEG and I challenge you to work out how to save an image in JPEG format! Click and Drag? - oh, no, that would be far too easy and obvious!!  The times I have needed Customer Services, I have had no response at all about my enquiries. There doesn't seem to be any Forum for users to get help and aid. At this rate I will need blood pressure tablets any day now! And incidentally, I also have another Canon printer which I use with a non-Windows or Mac computer. It is a BJC-250. It works perfectly and always has done. Never broken down. I can get the ink for it no problem. It is now about 30years old!!! The Good Old Days. eh?!

After 14 months the paper feed started making grinding noises &amp; still getting extra blank sheets when printing. It then started making REALLY NASTY NOISES!!!! - like a washing maching throwing itself around the room. I checked for anything jammed...Nope...nothing...perfectly clear.

                Second printer I've had with Canon and both have had issues. my printer was randomly missing out paper to print on which is not great as I need to print off double sided and it means the pages all end up mixed up. Contacted Canon support and was told even though my signal strength was a lot more than I needed I need to switch off my wifi. My wifi hub is not very accessible to me at time and when at the device I said; ""I've switched it off, I'll leave it a minute"" followed by ""OK I'm going to plug it back in."" Heard nothing off the person I was on the phone with. I get back to the printer and the adviser on the phone asks if the wifi is off yet. I couldn't stay calm so I said I had to go. This is the second printer I've had, the reason I had to buy this one is the old one needed one part replacing but Canon don't create that part as a spare part because without that part you can't use the printer/scanner at all. I put in a complain about them not producing the spare part but never heard anything back.

                My partner and I have, for a very long time, been very loyal customers to Canon  photographic equipment to the tune of £2000 so when we needed two printers we naturally went for Canon.   What a mistake!  Both devices recently died simultaneously through error Codes B203 and B200  (death of printer head.) When I rang to say how disappointed we were, I was told 'It was coincidental and we were lucky it lasted so long.' (Really? 3 years is long?) When I mentioned the huge number of negative reviews on this issue I was told that I had probably only read a few. They seemed surprised that I had read all 111! We were  told that one printer was discontinued and that the other might be repaired, but that it would be cheaper to buy a new device. We were also told that it would be difficult to find printers compatible to one of ours and that the only solution would be for us to  buy another PC! I said 'So we now have to buy one PC and two printers for the sake of a clear design fault on your part?'  Eventually we were offered a 20%  and then 30% voucher towards new printers to be spent in Canon's  online shop. We were not informed that there  was a limit on the kind of printers we could have and when asked they gave us a list of 24 printers (higher end) that were not open to us and therefore would not be able to replace our own higher end printers . They said that the offer was their standard procedure and they could do no more. When I said that I would therefore walk away and would never recommend Canon, they didn't appear in the least concerned.The only reason why I gave any star at all is the fact that individuals were not actually outright rude and and the fault lies entirely with the company.

                Bought a canon isensys with a 3 year warranty - experienced terrible print quality issues after 1 year of normal use - wanted to claim on the warranty and have now been waiting for 11 days to get a decision whether canon will honor the warranty - Canon put us on to an external repair and service  partner who refused to reply and had to be chased - after a week they sent an engineer who merely confirmed what we already know ie there was a problem - he didnt fix it and said that it would need an off site repair and the service engineers would get back to us - we chased the service engineers twice and are being told that they still don't know if it covered by the warranty and we will have to wait!!!!! I have called the Canon CS number  c 8 times and have insisted that I be escalated to a manager who can give me a decision - not ONCE have i been called back. It is now almost 2 weeks sorting this issue out and we are no further forward in getting a repair. When i call canon UK the receptionists tell me that the CEO UK doesnt accept external calls ! They dont have any idea of an individual who is in charge of customer services - its a total frustration getting canon to even speak to us let alone fix our printer !! When working the printer was ok but this customer services organisation is the worst that I have ever experienced - totally unresponsive and unsympathetic to  their customers needs - when a printer goes wrong it needs to be fixed quickly - its an essential tool these days. This is the second isensys that has gone wrong within a year and my fear is the reliability and longevity is just not there. If you are thinking of buying one please remember that you will - at some stage - want to use their service/repair/warranty capability and in our experience it is truly woeful - doesn't even deserve 1 star - buyers beware

                Right, let me first of all say that my experience with Canon UK (and by that I mean the official store!) was utterly faultless.   I made an order for a lens on a Thursday at 11am and recieved order confirmation immediately.   On Monday morning recieved an email from UPS saying delivery would be by the end of that day - the lens was delivered at 12pm midday.  I have to question whether or not these reviews are real, yes I know there are too many to be fake but why is this review page STILL unclaimed by Canon? Why have they not replied or responded to any of these reviews?   Please understand that Canon are of course not perfect, but they ARE a huge huge company selling fantastic cameras and lenses so you should of course be confident and relaxed when making a purchase.

                I have had problems with my pro-100s for months which the customer service advisor couldn't fix and which I was sent to 2nd their customer services for. I sent a detailed email with screenshots of settings and prints not matching etc. and had nothing back. I sent the emails again from a trusted account that I use on a daily basis, but nothing !   When I finally called up again I was told they couldn't help me as my case was already with 2nd tier and I needed to send the email again ! The 2nd tier eventually called my back after a few calls I couldn't get and took me through some settings. I am now out of ink after countless prints that weren't matching in colour and printing the wrong scale on the media selected. In short, I can't test whether my printer is now working as I have no ink left and Canon refused to send me a set of cartridges, despite the appalling service I've had. If you are looking for a printer, I'd stay clear of Canon as I've had countless problems with this printer and terrible service from Canon UK customer services.

                I have had 3 canon printers fail within a year and I print no more than a handful of pages per week and am a home user. A set of inks are £65 and printer repair quote I had was £89 and then when they got it the upped the repair quote to £120. These people are just crookes, I think they have shares in land fill sites as they seem determined to fill them with waste.

                Be very careful if you choose to do a Firmware update!  I opted to update the firmware on my canon camera, exactly as all of these manufacturers recommend you to do.  I followed the instructions exactly, to the letter.  Well it totally bricked my camera.  The only option was for it to go back to Canon and unbelievably they ended up replacing the main board in the camera.  They wanted to take no responsibility for it at all and kept repeating that you update at your own risk and sign disclaimer when downloading the software.  Well Canon, your software is NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE if it is capable of destroying a cameras main board!! They charged me almost £200 to fix the camera and that was after me arguing my case and being offered a discount.  After spending thousands on Canon equipment, this has left a very sour taste.  I can assure you it will be the last Canon purchase if that's how you treat customers.  It's the tone of arrogance that you get from the staff that really annoyed me.  That 'not our problem' type of response when you ask them for help.  Very poor service from a brand I had trusted for years.

                The worst 'shopping' experience and customer service experience I have had in my entire life. I bought a new camera for work, Canon took my money, the item didn't arrive. They told me apparently it MIGHT have gotten lost and that I have to wait for 'an investigation'. This might mean the item MIGHT arrive 4 weeks after Canon took my money - MAYBE. I would NEVER have bought the item if I knew it would arrive almost a month later! I would have gone to Amazon. I bought this for work and every day is costing me. Canon basically just shrug, oh well. No refund. No explanation. No support.

                Well Thank You Canon!  Like most Mac owners I am now running their latest operating system - Catalina. Apart from a few hiccups, it's great.  HOWEVER - on trying to update drivers for my printer I am very kindly advised by Canon that my Pixma MG6250 printer does not support Apple Catalina OS - but I can pick another printer from their range to purchase! My printer is not old, is in excellent condition and works - or did work - fine. So thank you very much Canon - I won't be buying anything from you again!

                Canon OnLine store didn't apply the 20% discount code they'd emailed me. The onLine Store ordering page actioned the camera (Ivy Rec) order without the discount. Canon admitted their systems weren't working properly. Only option was to send the delivery back and get a refund. Then re-order using the updated system. This was a product I wanted to buy, and actually had in my hands, but Canon couldn't refund the missing discount, so I had to return it. Madness. Needless to say, I'm not using the OnLine Store again. Canon: Why have a sophisticated mailing system with discount offers etc. but such a prehistoric order system? Get that sorted first, before unleashing your web marketing geniuses.

                I got my Canon printer due to my disabled students allowance, and wouldn't have picked getting a printer from this company if I had a choice.  The main problem with this printer is that it's been programmed to waste the coloured inks to print black, if you print a document in colour. So, even if you have a tiny image in colour, all the rest of the print work will be done combining the other coloured inks to make black, rather than using one of the two black inks the printer has.  This makes printer extremely wasteful, I've hone through 5 packs of inks and not even halfway through a pack of 500 sheets of printer paper. When the inks are £50+ for a set of Canon inks, this is ridiculously expensive.  They've clearly programmed the printer to ignored the two black inks whenever you print something in the colour setting, in order to force their customers to buy there inks far more frequently than they'd be needed if they'd been programmed to always use one of the two black inks to print black, even when using the coloured printing option.  Avoid buying printers from this company, they will rip you off to make money from ink sales

I've removed and thoroughly cleaned the printer head, as per numerous YouTube videos, but the error persists. I've only used the printer for occasional use. The print quality was always poor and now product reliablity has proven to be abysmal. I've binned it for a more reliable make and I shall never buy another Canon product again!

                I attempted to buy a Canon M50 camera from the Canon Online Shop whilst away from home on holiday in Norfolk. I followed the webpage instructions implicitly but when I came to the payment section the Canon webpage system repeatedly crashed for what appeared no reason. I thought it may have been the bank card that was being refused as my cards had recently been replaced with new ones so I rang my bank. They confirmed that Canon was taking the money from my account but almost instantly was returning the money to my account for no reason that they could determine. They assured me that it was not the bank blocking the payment and I therefore needed to contact Canon. I tried ringing Canon several times but could not get beyond listening to never ending messages about how busy they were. I then tried ordering the camera again and it worked perfectly and stated the camera would be delivered in two days time. I automatically thought they must have had a glitch which had been rectified. I then left to go to John Lewis store in Norwich to buy a lens adapter for the camera which was about £30 cheaper than buying it from Canon with the camera! When I came to pay for the adapter I found my bank card was refused which rather stunned me. I tried credit card from the same bank and that was also refused. I then tried my wife's bank card and that was refused. Embarrassingly I was forced to go to the bank to find out what was going on. I found at the bank that Canon had returned the payment 1 hour after taking it and cancelled my order of the camera and stopped its delivery. This action coupled with with the earlier refusals by Canon had caused the bank systems to think illegal transactions were been attempted and automatically closed all my accounts and stopped my bank cards! Fortunately I had gone to the bank in person  and they were able to immediately clear all stops and reactivate all the accounts and cards. At no time during all this did Canon ever get in touch with me to tell me what they were doing, why they were doing it or ask for further information from me about my attempts to buy a camera from them. I therefore then went to the local Norwich PcWorld/Currys and bought the camera over the counter for the same price as Canon (there was a £150 discount offer at the time from Canon). I was annoyed with Canon as I had had an extremely stressful and embarrassing day whilst on holiday. I wrote an email to Canon Service to let them know what they had put me through and expected to get some form of apology. I only got the explanation that their system had noticed that the delivery address on my order was different from my home address in shown in records from earlier purchases over the years. I pointed out that their system did not ask at any time for my home address and when I put in my son's address in Norwich as the delivery address it did not query it, it did not flag up a problem, it merely continued to the payment section of the system which to start with had accepted the card details 3 times and then crashed without explanation but then later accepted the same details fully. I have written several emails and each one has been replied to by saying it was completely my fault, their systems are there to protect me from fraudulent attempts of bank card scams, etc. etc. They refuse to accept any blame for the stress and embarrassment they put me through and make it quite clear they will not entertain any possibility that their system was at fault. Life is to short to continue the argument with Canon so I have demanded they remove all trace of me from their records with an emphasis on their knowledge of my bank details as I simply do not trust or respect them as company. This is very sad for me as I have bought many Canon cameras, lenses and printers since my first Canon SLR EOS 600 in 1986 but now I have the distinct feeling that if you have a problem with them or their products they are not interested in the slightest.Goodbye Canon.

                My Canon MG7150 printer stopped working and displayed an error code. When I contacted Canon support, I was informed that the error code meant the printer had an internal fault which would be very expensive to repair and I'd be better purchasing a new printer. They ""helpfully"" gave me a 30% discount code, BUT only to be used at Canon's online store. I wasn't satisfied with this and did a bit of rooting around on the internet to discover the fault code indicated a simple paper jam that I cleared in a couple of minutes! I don't know if this was a genuine error by the support team, a rogue individual scamming to increase commission, or scamming at a corporate scale, but whatever it is, it was an appalling episode and Canon should be ashamed. It wasn't so much the cost of buying a new printer that concerned me, as the waste of all the embodied energy and carbon that would have been jettisoned had I taken Canon's advice to through away a perfectly serviceable printer!

                The mirror in my Canon 5Dfell off during a photoshoot. I contacted Canon and found out my camera had a recall for this issue. I asked to send it in to be fixed, and they said they could not do that for me, but they could offer me an upgrade. They then quoted me $3,000 for an upgraded camera. I wasn't prepared for my mirror falling out, therefore I didn't save up 3 grand for a new canera. They made it seem like it couldn't be repaired. A photographer friend send me a link to a youtube video, and $5.62 later my camera is good as new. That was horrible customer service. Really quite unhappy about how they wouldn't take ownership for this recall and fix it. I spend too much money for them to treat me like this.

                I bought a Canon PowerShot SX620 HS in March 2019. Within 4 months, the retracting lens got stuck. I was on holiday and I could not place the camera in its case anymore. When I flown back to England, the camera got a chip. Upon my return, I called the customer service where I bought the camera and I was invited to bring the camera to the store. They took it for repair. However, when I called to get some update with the repair, I learned that even though I bought the camera 4 months ago, I lost the guarantee because of the chip. I explained that the chip happened because the retracting lens was stuck but it doesn't matter. CANON rejects all warranties by saying that the clients lose the warranty if there is a physical damage on the electrical device. Ok, I lost the warranty so I asked about the repair. I was told they won't repair and the repair centre offered to replace my camera for almost the same price I bought it 4 months ago. Why should I buy again a camera that failed me? As I did not intent to buy a new camera, I ask about the possibility of repair. Then the customer service assistant explained to me that CANON  does not repair anything anymore. THEY HAVE OUTSOURCED their repair centres. To simplify the process, CANON does not have any repair facilities anymore, they just focuss on selling. When a device is broken, it is sent to one of the outsource repair centres. If the device is under warranty, CANON is charged for the repair. If the device is not under warranty, the client is charged for the repair. CANON does not want to lose money so take as little responsibilities as possible and it works well when everybody loses their warranty if there is a single physical damage. You have a chip and you're done! You just lost your warranty. The outsource repair centres are there to earn money as fast as possible. In my case, they simply offered me to replace the product at the same price I purchased it. Like this, they don't have to pay for new pieces, don't spend time in repair, just sell you the same thing you already have and tell you to bin your camera. When I explained again that the camera was new, which means that  all the components were new and that only the lens had an issue, they said that it was too expensive to fix and they have to discard it and that I need to buy a new one. CONCLUSION: I was told to threw my camera away and buy a new one. All their devices are simply treated as pieces of junk. If your device breaks, you are likely to be told to threw it away. CANON LOOKS FOR PROFIT, NEGLECTS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND POLLUTE THE PLANET. Avoid this kind of companies that don't care about the environment.

                Printer performs ok, but the ink usage and cost is extortionate. Two problems - Firstly, the printer cleans its print head virtually continuously, even before and after printing a single full stop. Secondly, All colours in a single cartridge, plus separate black cartridge which together cost more than a new printer that comes with cartridges. I've printed about 6 A4 colour pics and cartridge nearly empty.

Had to go back to the store where they tell me I have to wait 3 weeks for repairs. for real? The thing isn't even half a year old and I have to wait 3 weeks for the repairs of a machine that probably will break down again the next few months; What a load of buttocks. Why is everything such feces quality these days. Whats next? Buying new thing that are broken from the get go?

                canon rp - complete waste of money. i am in the process of returning the camera as it was bought through a rd party seller, but i will probably lose some money from postal return.  I bought the camera as option to be silent against my 5D mark IV which i can only use in a sound blimp and only on fully automatic as my blimp has no access to the dials when closed.   When the camera arrived in the manual it says silent mode but doesn't explain anything about silent mode. So i phoned canon. I asked how can i get into silent mode and they said i had to turn the main dial to SCN and then scroll down on the viewer to mute sound. Great i thought - don't know how this wasn't explained in the manual. While still speaking to the customer service agent it becomes i apparent i can't change any settings and this silent mode is fully automatic. The customer service agent doesn't know and i am put on hold. The line goes dead. I phone back. again i ask the question and again i am put on hold. this time the person comes back to me and say yes unfortunately it is only fully automatic. So this means i have spent money on something i can do already. Why would any mode on a expensive camera be only automatic??? Give me the choice. let me choose what is my priority the camera doesn't know what i am trying to achieve and what my plan is. I complained. I have just had a phone call back from them. They apologised and said having silent on fully automatic was a business decision and could not justify why it wasn't on manual. He would send my comments on to canon, but lets be honest that means nothing. when will canon realise they are so behind the times on mirrorless, that adding features that are they quite unusuable you are charging too much for poor features. The person i spoke to said we do have a silent one, but it is £1,500 more expensive than the flawed RP, for that one extra feature. I only chose canon because i have lots of canon lens so using a converter would save me money overall buying new lens with a different mirrorless. In my mind the benefits of a mirrorless against a dslr should be weight and quietness, all other extras are a plus and some are nice but not essential if you have a high end dslr. It seems canon arrogance is getting to mirrorless late, advertising features incorrectly and charging as much as the high end mirrorless, that aren't even worth half the price.  My view unless canon sort themselves out soon they are not the company to buy cameras from anymore. And have never been for mirrorless as they aren't in touch with real peoples needs unless money is no object and you are happy to spend money on overpriced substandard devices.

                I have a 9 month old Canon Pixma TS5050 which, up until now has been temperamental, but has worked. Have used (quality) remanufactured cartridges since new owing to eye-watering cost of originals. Printer recognises all the cartridges, displays the ink levels, but has suddenly decided not to print using Cyan cartridge. Tried all recommended cleaning &amp; alignement processes, no error messages, but that colour still missing. Canon solution? It's the ink density (all of a sudden!) - buy one of our mega expensive cartridges &amp; all will be OK. No other possible solution available. By the way - reject the printer &amp; unless all the cartridges are Canon Originals, the warranty is void. It is actually economically viable to junk it &amp; buy a new printer rather than purchase Canon Cartridges.

Clearly, Canon is just another faceless corporate entity, cynically seeing it’s customers as stupid, ignorant cash cows, with no intelligence and empty pockets. The absolute stupidity, of this decision can be likened to making one interchangeable lens, just to fit one particular camera. I can see that with the type of marketing and production logic, applied to the 470 ex-ai, this will be what they’ll be telling us in a few years.  As a beginner, I thoroughly regret choosing Canon instead of choosing another camera manufacturer and see buying into the Canon ecosystem as a big mistake.

                I recently experienced trouble with a Canon 1.4x extender mk3 where it would not unlock from my Canon 500mm f4 prime lens. The unlocking switch would move but it would not come off the lens. Eventually after some rocking of the extender it came off with a little effort. I was receiving err 01 messages on the camera which indicated the camera and lens were not communicating and as the extender was between the two the assumed cause. The extender had to be removed to allow for the camera and lens to continue to be used.  Later the camera and extender were reattached so I could try it all out after cleaning the connectors however the camera rolled off of the lens and smashed on the ground damaging beyond use the LCD.  The camera has gone through my insurers but the extender has gone to Canon UK for repair as I found that no matter what I did it would now not lock onto the lens, the outer housing will rotate.  Canon have blamed my for damaging the extender ( the outer housing rotation) and insist I pay for the repair however this is unacceptable as the initial issue was with the extender not coming off the lens in the first place, i.e. it was not doing what it should have done and I was using it as an extender should be used. The damage was as a result of getting it off. Granted the damage to house may have been caused by me removing the extender but If the extender had done what it was meant to do in the first instance there would have been A) no damage to extender housing and B) damage to my camera's LCD resulting in extended period of time with out it.  Canon are blinkered to the fact the issue was in the very first instance down to the extender locking onto the lens and I have been quoted 'it's outside of warranty (it's only 2 years old but only comes with 1 years warranty which says a lot; Canon probably know its poorly made and expect money out of future repairs), damage to the housing as a result of getting off the lens.  As it was outside of warranty I was happy to pay the standard repair cost but now wanting me to pay for the damage that would not have occurred for the above reasons. These things are not cheap and I would expect it last a lot longer than the 4 months or so use over the period of 2 years that I have had it, It spends most of the time in the camera bag.  I can see why a lot of Canon users are moving to Nikon and after being a 20year Canon user this level of customer service will make me consider jumping to Canon's rivals as well.

I would have liked to exchange it but I was told I had to return the faulty one for a refund before I would then be able to order a new one. Canon arranged a courier to collect the item but their appointed courier failed to show up on the first 2 times I waited in so it took 3 attempts to get it collected. A complete nightmare given Canon would only offer a weekday collection from 8am-6pm and despite my repeated pleas after the first 2 failed attempts would not offer a priority service, allow me to leave it out for the courier or send it back on my own. I finally managed to get the printer returned but several days later there was no sign of my refund. When I contacted Canon they told me they need to send the printer on to their warehouse in Germany for inspection before they can then issue the refund.They sent me a broken printer, I've returned and they still have my money! Every time I try and speak to customer services they are rude and unhelpful. The call centre handlers obviously have a very tight script they are not allowed to deviate from and show absolutely no empathy for the difficult position they put their customers in. I have been a Canon customer for cameras and printers for over 20 years but as a result of this experience I will NEVER purchase from them again. If you are considering purchasing a Canon product I would strongly recommend you use a different retailer who understands what proper customer service should look like.

                Well have to say I had no problems whatsoever with the service provided by Canon service centre in Elstree UK. After my 70D was diagnosed with a known problem to this model they took it back and repaired it within a few days. I was not charged and received the camera back safely packaged securely simple as that. Very pleased with the outcome.

                I felt obligated to write a review. I have a very inexpensive canon pixma printer. Cost me about $40 on Amazon. Few months ago it wasnt working properly and I called the Canon support line. The rep was very patient and helpful and determined that it couldnt be fixed and he shipped me a new one for free.   Today, that printer stopped working correctly and the paper kept getting jammed inside. I called the support line again and the rep was also very helpful, walked me through a few steps, and within about 15 minutes we had it working again.   I have to say that I a very pleased with canon's support.

                In the last 2 years I have owned 2 Canon Printers, an MG5650 which  failed just out of warranty, which would only print A5 if it felt like it, and an MG3050 purchased in November 2018, which ate ink &amp; missed pages. The assistance from Canon support was useless, &amp; I ditched both printers, despite the latter still being under warranty. I have since purchased an HP printer which is in a totally different quality league. The Canon products were unreliable &amp; their customer service absolutely appalling!

                I purchased a brand new TS9551C printer from the Canon Store but it was faulty when delivered. I would have liked to exchange it but I was told I had to return the faulty one for a refund before I would then be able to order a new one. Canon arranged a courier to collect the item but their appointed courier failed to show up on the first 2 times I waited in so it took 3 attempts to get it collected. A complete nightmare given Canon would only offer a weekday collection from 8am-6pm and despite my repeated pleas after the first 2 failed attempts would not offer a priority service, allow me to leave it out for the courier or send it back on my own. I finally managed to get the printer returned but several days later there was no sign of my refund. When I contacted Canon they told me they need to send the printer on to their warehouse in Germany for inspection before they can then issue the refund.They sent me a broken printer, I've returned and they still have my money! Every time I try and speak to customer services they are rude and unhelpful. The call centre handlers obviously have a very tight script they are not allowed to deviate from and show absolutely no empathy for the difficult position they put their customers in. I have been a Canon customer for cameras and printers for over 20 years but as a result of this experience I will NEVER purchase from them again. If you are considering purchasing a Canon product I would strongly recommend you use a different retailer who understands what proper customer service should look like.

Edited 15 February 2019 to add - When I telephoned them, they really did not care that the item which should have been delivered had, by mistake, been taken back to the carrier's warehouse.  Despite having two emails from the carriers that the item would be delivered that day, all Canon would say is that delivery can take 3-5 days.  Like banging my head against a brick wall.

                I have a Canon Maxify MB5455 multi function printer that developed a fault after 14 months of light use.  I had the extended 'exchange warranty' which meant the printer was still covered by warranty. I reported the problem to canon who required the original receipt to validate my warranty and then they arranged for a replacement (exchange) printer to be sent.  Although this all took about a week I received the replacement printer. Once set up this 'new' printer immediately displayed an error message and would not work. After calling the support line once again it was established that the printer has a fault that could not be fixed by me. This printer was returned and yet another 'replacement/exchange' printer was sent out which, although two days later than promised, arrived 10 days after my initial complaint. On setting up this new-2nd exchange/replacement printer it also displayed the same fault message as the two previous printers. After numerous calls and emails Canon finally agreed to send me a new printer which arrived today (more than three weeks after my first call) and after set up worked as it should do.  Canon clearly have many many issues, both product quality, process issues, staff issues, management issues and logistics issues all of which demonstrates a company that does not care for or look after its customers. Each person I spoke to was pleasant and seemed to understand and agree with my frustration but, despite this, it is clear that the whole process is broken as is the loyalty of many of their customers - like me. Just read the other Truspilot reviews on Canon. Very sad state of affairs. Bye bye Canon.

                Has Canon been replaced with Conem  ??  Con 'em all! ??! It sure seems like it.  I used to rate Canon as 5 star but my experience with their products is unfortunately all too common among others that purchase the very same productsm of late.  Something needs to be done seriously i mean it, otherwise, watch this space, Canon will be history! Which is sad, as they used to be sooo good in my opinion.  I have recently HAD to buy a new printer from them because that very common PRINTHEAD mystery problem popped up with my nearly new, well 18 month old printer!  Other than that this printer worked fine.  So I purchase the all new updated compact nice looking printer of theirs called the MG5750 which is also wireless.  And boy, have I had so many connectivity and operational issues with it! If it does connect, then there's another problem, the printer says it's out of paper. I go upstairs to check, and lo and behold, the tray has ample amounts of paper!   So many times when I try to print it either doesn't connect or says the printer is in use or some other error which stops it from printing, then it decides to print 2 days later what I sent to it!  ABSOLUTE RUBBISH when you're trying to run a business! I aint got time for Canon crap!  Change your ways or millions will change theirs and jump from this seemingly sinking ship!  Seems like a cannon ball has blasted a hole right through this ship, and it's sinking in terrible untested products and poor quality functions!  I also recently purchase a video camera, which is not being used, because their AP doesn't work properly! SO it's useless! I am not one to complain normally, BUT this is just unacceptable!

                While in general my printer has worked well, I have a big issue with my experience with Canon customer service. I called asking for help to set up my wireless printer on a new network, since no instructions could be found online. Instead of trouble shooting with me, the representative immediately asked to take control of my computer screen. Before making any attempt to connect my printer to the wireless network he pulls up some screen and starts talking about how my computer has ""hackers"" that have messed up my printer. Tries to talk me into paying $400 to be connected to someone remove them and ""re-intall software"". He refused to provide me with the number he was going to connect me to, and when I declined this service, he hung up on me. I ran my anti-malware software - which found NO threats/issues on my computer. Then spend another 40 minutes troubleshooting by myself and was able to connect the printer and get it to work again. I'm very disappointing with this companies ""customer service"" and glad I didn't get conned into spending all that money on nothing.

                Having bought Canon products before I confidently bought a Powershot SX720 HS camera recently. Massive mistake. Unfortunately the future is wireless and the camera is supposed to connect to other devices to download the photos, but sadly it fails to do this. Canon's own technical support were unable to do it, but took 45 minutes to talk me through the instructions I had followed myself online only for them to discover it doesn't work for them either. They offered to escalate the issue but that support was less than useless, sending woefully inadequate instructions and referring me back to the instructions they themselves confirmed didn't work. The only option? Take a day off work and wait in for a call (as they only work 8.30 - 15.30 Mon- Friday, despite opening hours being until 20.00) or buy an interface cable at extra cost. No thanks, I will be getting a refund and steering clear of Canon in the future

                For context, I use this DSLR camera for Youtube videos mainly.  I originally bought a Canon 80D despite having doubts, the video footage never looked that sharp to me. That said, after trying it myself I wasn't happy with it so sent it back.  When looking for an alternative, many were saying the 6D 2 was too similar but a lot more expensive. I disagree, for me the video footage of the 6d 2 is a lot sharper and generally a lot better out of the box. No need to sharpen in post production.  Happy with the purchase. Overall this is my second Canon camera. Never had to contact support so don't know how good they are (bought and refunded my 80D via Amazon), but overall can't complain with the Canon experience.

Every time I turn it on to scan a document to my PC it cleans the print heads, so now £60 of ink has been completely wasted. I messaged Canon for a solution, they told me that the printer will clean the heads every time you turn it on, and again a few minutes after you print anything, even one character, it will clean itself !!!!! I asked them if the auto clean function could be turned off, as I am sure most people are clever enough to see when the printer heads needed cleaning from what they can see on the printed page, so why can't there be a setting to turn off the auto clean and the user to manually run a clean cycle when needed. They said 'that's the way it is' and it can't be turned off. They suggested that I '' Leave the printer switched on 24/7 '' as then it wouldn't waste as much ink as it would be in stand by !!!! When I suggested that as a company who supposedly cared for the environment, this was a completely ludicrous statement, and would only lead to energy being wasted for zero need, guess what, they never replied. Anyway, from this I have concluded that Canon do not care about the customer or the environment, and the Auto clean setting is there just to waste ink, thus potentially making more profit for themselves.

After several emails to Canon we got no response at all offering any help with this problem. The Ixus camera battery which was supposed to take about 190 photos on one charge gave up after 15 photos and had to be recharged. The main concern  is the fact that Canon offer £35 cashback on the Legria Camcorder, however don't be tempted by this offer it is false. I applied three times and all they do is keep coming up with excuses but no sign of the cash. My advice: stick to Japanese electronics they are much more reliable.

After several emails to Canon we got no response at all offering any help with this problem. The Ixus camera battery which was supposed to take about 190 photos on one charge gave up after 15 photos and had to be recharged. The main concern  is the fact that Canon offer Â£35 cashback on the Legria Camcorder, however don't be tempted by this offer it is false. I applied three times and all they do is keep coming up with excuses but no sign of the cash. My advice: stick to Japanese electronics they are much more reliable.

                Poor service by Canon USA Customer Support, they do not care about their customers.  I have just bought a Canon EOS M5 which turns out to have the Bluetooth address of all zeros. All zeros is an invalid Bluetooth address, not recognised by other devices. I wanted Canon to tell  me if there is a way to fix this by changing the Bluetooth address to a valid one or should the camera be returned for an exchange/refund. After a trail of emails (they do reply to emails, there is just little relevant information in their replies) where each time I was getting a reply from a different person, they told me to send the camera to one of the repair centres and fill the form for a REPAIR COST QUOTATION??? They did not even bother to read my emails! Totally unacceptable.

                FAO Cisco and Potential Future Candidates:   I have been studying towards my ICND1 since July and have invested a lot of time in to learning and mastering the Cisco study material. Firstly, I have had multiple issues where the site has been down or labs are unavailable which has resulted in me pushing back my exam 3 times due to the loss of study time. I raised this with Cisco and had to settle for a gesture of good will refund which was around 12% - appreciated however money doesn't buy the time back.   Please also note, this is also time sensitive as I will need to complete my CCNA exam before February as it will be discontinued due to the changes.   Today I sat my ICND1 exam, during my exam - the lab failed and froze on a 4-part question. I raised this with the lady at the test center who came to take a look and didn't pause my time until 5 minutes after verifying that there indeed was an issue (so 5 minutes exam time lost) - then once she phoned Cisco, they advised her I would have to skip the 4-part question and carry on. So I did. My score was 816 and my pass mark was 832, I in myself know I passed as I knew the answer to the question which I was unable to answer due to Cisco's error. Even if I was able to answer 1 part out of the 4-part question, I would have passed.   As soon as I left the test center, I contacted Cisco - after speaking with a customer service representative, then the supervisor (Daniel) and then the manager (Ali) - I was advised that this needs to be looked at by the technical team and I should expect a phone call in 3-5 working days. I was also advised that I cannot resit the exam for 7 days due to company policy, even though this was their mistake. On top of this, the manager advised me that at most they would be able to offer me is a refund once this has been looked in to by the technical team. I find this completely outrageous that I have failed an exam due to their mistake and all they can offer me is a refund.   This does not compensate for the time I have taken off work, the stress I have experienced with this exam and potential further time off work. I should be able to resit the 4-part question (or one similar) and not have to re-do the whole test again.   My certificate with my score says ""As a Cisco certification candidate, you deserve a fair and secure testing experience"" - This was most definitely not a fair experience. Even if/when Cisco offer a re-sit of my exam, this is still not justifiable. I should have passed today and this was all down to Cisco. After my CCNA, I will never sit a Cisco certification again and I definitely would not recommend Cisco to anyone.

                I purchased, and continued to buy up to date, Cisco products, certain of their business strength and therefore trusting in excellent customer service. Never what was wrong! Despite months of calls and emails trying to get me to attend for their semi-professional router guaranteed for life, the WRSV4400N, Cisco has deliberately decided not to provide any assistance for their product, a lifetime guaranteed memory and no longer working, although it is It has always been used under the Smart Ups APC UPS. And to say that I have always bought and bought Cisco to friends, law firms and other professionals, in the belief, now clearly wrong, to treat a brand of excellence as can be that of Apple, a company that, unlike Cisco, until today He never disappointed me. When the WRSV4400N started to reboot continuously becoming unusable, I immediately ordered a Cisco RV340 and, a few days later, an RV130W, this happened on 2 November 2018. My trust was placed in Cisco even if sometimes its products do not they are really up to date, the RV130W does not have the Fi AC protocol. I think the company policy on products with a lifetime warranty must be known to everyone so that others are not fooled by Cisco. Even their commercial practice in Italy is considered incorrect by virtue of deceptive advertising on a product guaranteed for life. Deeply disappointed by Cisco

                To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. I bought a brand new $80 Cuisinart coffee pot and it recently stopped working after somewhat infrequent use over a year (and a few months).   I contacted Cuisinart support and I have to say that the experience was horrible. I found out that I had to pay for shipping to have the new coffee pot sent to me AND I have to pay for shipping to send the cord from the old coffee pot back to them.   Rather than switching to a new brand immediately, I decided to give them a chance. I gave them my serial number, model number, and shipping information.   Skip forward to today. The new coffee pot arrived and they sent me the wrong color. Now I have a coffee pot that doesn't go with anything in my kitchen. AND, I STILL HAVE TO PAY THEM FOR THEIR ERROR!   I always thought of Cuisinart as a well known, well-trusted home brand. Apparently, that is no longer the case.

                I bought a kettle from this company, similar to one that had lasted many years, the new one has a glitch on the display, if set to 85 degrees it flashes 75C for a second or two, also it does not always turn off when boiling at 100C. The company said they would replace it with a later batch model, they didn't so the replacement had the same issues and then even though I sent a video of the issue they supposedly could not replicate the problem and were highly dismissive, i felt they thought I was lying.   They retuned the old kettle for some unknown reason with no protecting packaging loose in a box and and it was covered in scratches and dents, a weird practice and not great to be left being basically called a liar and seeing returns treated so badly. Avoid this company, they don't care at all and the kettle was over £70, and don't expect returns in a good condition, I binned mine it was that bad, not that it was needed. So I'm still stuck with a kettle with this issue still, well that's just great Cuisinart, thanks for nothing.

                I bought the Cuisinart Ice Cream and Gelato Professional.  It's just amazing, it's so easy to use too.  So far I've made vanilla ice cream, mango, cherry, peach, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, lemon and lime, banana, pineapple, chocolate orange, mint and chocolate chip, mandarin, toffee and baileys!  It was a bit pricey but well worth the money, I will never buy shop bought ice cream again!   The recipes are a good guide and I just adapted them to suit the flavours that I was creating. The recipes do say to use double cream, but I use the 'thicker double cream' and the results are perfect. With the baileys I think I used to much of it and the setting wasn't as good, but if you eat it quick enough then it's fine, it did give hubby and headache the next morning!  I did however have to buy lots of containers from Ikea and a new small chest freezer just to accommodate all the ice cream!  Well worth buying, I got mine from John Lewis and it's guaranteed for five years. I cannot fault this item.

                After trying George Foreman, Russell Hobbs etc. etc. all failed on design and difficulty keeping clean. The Cuisinart grill was a bit more expensive but well worth it, design is brilliant can use opened out to form two hot plates, plates are reversible for grill or griddle cooking. They are also removable for easy clean or dishwasher. Drip tray is huge and easy to empty and is integral to machine so always in position to catch drips. Two controls with various heat settings...only cringe is drain off into drip tray is very small and tends to get blocked not a big issue.

                After trying to make a purchase, I found several bad reviews here and on other sites for the cuisinart web store.  Came to realize that my order placed on the cuisinart site got me a order confirmation from the web store.  Then noticed that pricing, products, contact information, etc is all the same, so it is actually just their outlet.     Granted, I am spoiled by Amazon and their speed and quality, but my experience so far was - Order placed last week tuesday.  Email confirmation on wednesday morning that the order was received.  It's cookie season so I paid for 2 day shipping to get my replacement blade quickly.  Friday rolls around, no tracking number or any other word.  I try to call customer service and after 15 minutes on hold give up. Send an email, and get the we will get back to you in 24 to 48 hours  response.   Monday rolls around, still no response. So now it's coming up on a week, and still nothing.     Then I figured out the whole shenanigans of the two sites being related.  Found a bunch of online reviews complaining about slow shipping, no shipping, wrong items shipped, and poor customer service.   So, decide to just cancel the orders.  Just got off the phone with customer service (this time it only took 12 minutes on hold).  It's a telling statement when I say I have to cancel an order, and they just respond with what's the number, and ok you're all set.  They must get that request a lot if there's not even a question about why or what the issue was, and what they could do to fix the situation.   Looks like I will be buying another food processor instead of fixing it, and you can bet it won't be a Cuisinart.

When called a week later to be refunded I was told they don't just refund someone will be out to look at it. Well they came out and looked at it and something on the machine was bad. Our company wanted to just get rid of this shredder but they had to send us another one. Promising us we would be so happy with it. Finally weeks later after poor communication we were sent another one. What a hassle it was to get it into the box witch the movers wouldn't do. Once the new one was received we set it up and it has been nothing but problems also.It does not shut off and if you don't check it important things are left in the tray UN shredded.

The vents on the inside started to rust as well. A week ago it started smelling like wires were burning. This is the 3rd one I've had issues  with. I bought them because the price is reasonable and I like them. This is disappointing because now I have to buy another one and it will be the 4th one in less than 4 years. I didn't wanna give the the 1 star, their products suck!

                When contacted about our defective coffee pot, they offered all kinds of STUPID solutions that I knew (and told them) wouldn’t change anything. After several failed attempts they asked us to return our unit for evaluation, not mentioning that it could take 6 weeks to get results!...Like, NO COFFEE POT FOR 6 WEEKS! 😤 We emailed them several times, but obviously NOBODY cares!

The person I spoke to could not have cared less.  I was not looking for a replacement just to alert the company of a design flaw (in my opinion).  I am 70 years old so I have had a few blenders in my life from which to compare.  They just lost a customer.  I'll not buy any of their appliances in the future.  When I stated that fact to the rep.

                This is simply the WORST company and support department I've dealt with since ever. They FORCE you to do pay a very convenient shipping charge. No pick-up options or similar. It is a very subtle way to ""deny"" your warranty claim. The company behind it and the support department don't care about fairness with consumers, they just want to get their money. In the event, something goes wrong and a warranty claim is required, be ready to ""pay"" to get it replaced. The company expects consumers to  ""pay"" almost a very convenient 50% price of what the unit cost was to get it replaced. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, just throw it away or go straight to your Government Consumer Protection department or Attorney's General Office and call AMAZON and leave a seller's feedback. With that said, I simply cannot support this company and those very inconvenient warranty practices. I really do not recommend buying from them. If you still like the brand and product, suggest to buy it from a major department store (Walmart, Target, or similar) that you can simply return it if anything goes wrong with it, or get another brand that supports practices that are more consumer-friendly.

                I purchased the Hamilton Beach 2-way flexbrew coffee maker. I would suggest cusomers do your research before buying this coffee maker. The single brew constantly has coffee grinds in the coffee, 2 times out of 4 coffee grinds are in my coffee. even after going through the troubleshooting steps to correct the issue. I would suggest customers do some additional research on coffee makers before buying this one.

I have never been so disappointed in a company in my 52 years of living. They have wasted so much of my time just trying to return an item. I have officially said screw it. It is no longer worth my time after phone calls, taking pictures, writing emails and not getting responses...so I'm writing follow up emails...  makes one wonder if they are going under. If so, good.

                What a complete piece of dog sh!t.  It's criminal to put products on the market that are dangerous....and charge people for them.  For Christ sake, spend the extra money for a product that has been designed and engineered to make your life (and your food prep) easier.  Their Goddamn toasters have a lip on them that doesn't allow toast (frozen waffle/ english muffins') to pop up when they are done toasting.  I finally burned the sh!t out of my thumb trying to get my toast out of the mother phucking thing this morning (I've been flirting with disaster every time I use this  plastic , ridiculously engineered piece of monkey sh!t).  Phuuck Hamilton Beach and their design team.  Vote with your dollar and do not support their products'!!!

                I bought a few Hamilton Beach microwaves and 2 of them started sparking inside when I turned on, after a few months. When I called Hamilton Beach Customer service, after 1 hour I was able to talk to a human who gave a reference number for refund / replacement and asked me to take these items to a Walmart Store. Walmart Store refused to accept the return and asked me contact Walmart.com! When I reached out to Walmart.com rep, she flatly refused to accept the return as it was purchased 3 months ago and refused to process the refund even though I gave her the reference number which I received from Hamilton Beach. After wasting so much time, Walmart.com gave a promo coupon of $25 for a microwave that cost $49.99 provided I spend at least $45 through Walmart.com again!. So, do not buy from Walmart.com and if you do and if you try to return to Walmart Store, good luck trying to get a refund or replacement even though the manufacturer may give a ref number for refund/replacement! No Hamilton Beach Products please and no walmart.com again!  The good thing is that I had SquareTrade extended warranty taken for one item. They came to my rescue and agreed to provide a full refund for this item as they understood my frustration. Thanks SquareTrade, you are the savior!

                Hamilton Beach - shame on you. Husband got a breakfast sandwich maker for Christmas &amp; found it to overheat (badly!!), causing the paint to pucker. (we knew it was defective as our son also rc'd one for Christmas &amp; his works great) I emailed Hamilton Beach &amp; was told that their ""limited warranty"" is for 30 days... doesn't matter that it was purchased 11/9 for a Christmas present, so we would have to pay shipping for a replacement ($9.99 - almost 1/2 the total cost new!). Did I mention that we had to get a gift receipt to prove when &amp; where it was purchased? After 10 emails back &amp; forth, attaching copies of the product &amp; the gift receipt a total of 4 times I called the 800# (as my last email said that the shipping charge was now $12.99) with hopes that there was someone who would be willing to discuss this, was on hold for 18 minutes, and then was treated like a waste of Cassandra, NC's time. ""Customer Service"", I think not. Needless to say we will NEVER EVER purchase anything in the future from Hamilton Beach. Warning for all our friends &amp; others as to how they treat their customers as their way of thinking appears to be you bought it, it's yours, even if it's defective on their end.

                Do not buy their blender! I had an Osterizer from the 1980s that did a great job until a child pulled it off the counter last year. One year into a new Hamilton Beach, I've replaced the jar twice as the base chipped during washing, the lid vent never closed properly and has to be held down while in use, the button labels have all worn off and it blends poorly compared to the old Osterizer. I will be searching thrift stores for an oldie but goody. Plus an extremely short power cord. Don't waste your time and money with a Hamilton Beach blender.

                In January I bought a basic PC to work from home. HP Pavilion i3 4GB 1TB Desktop PC 318/4033.  It was replacing a trusty old Dell which operated Windows 7 and I was persuaded that I needed to move on.  This PC is described on argos.co.uk as 'powerful' and 'exceeds expectations'. Sadly it is the WORST PC I have ever had. Their support people have performed various remote checks (they say it's all fine) and advised me to do complete reset which I have done. It remains painfully slow.  HP help staff have tried to blame it on Microsoft - ultimately this PC is not capable of operating basic MS office and day to work with documents and websites; I click and there is even a wait before the never ending spinning cursor appears. I have spent hours and hours trying to solve this or just waiting for the machine to respond. I have asked HP to send me a machine that works but - no response. I'm planning to unplug it and go back to the old Dell.

                I am in the UK and bought an HP Envy Photo printer 6234 at the end of August 2019. I then went on holiday overseas until the 6th November 2019 so I hadn't used it. Since my return in November I have hardly used it as its just a home printer. In March 2020 the cartridges jammed and despite many conversations with HP technical support in India they agreed they needed to replace it. The replacement arrived about a week later and when I opened it I realized it wasn't a new one! When I asked I was told they just send out refurbished models. Surely not correct? When I tried to set it up, it wouldn't connect to my Wi Fi. Again hours spent on the phone to different people at HP in India  all telling me to do the same things that I'd tried with other HP employees whom I'd spoken to. In the end they said they would replace it again.....but not a new one. Yesterday 6th April I spoke with one of their people in Lisbon Portugal who argued with me about the timing on his email for him to call me. Such a rude man. Again saying they would not give me a new printer or refund my money. I said I wanted to contact someone much higher than him and he said that he would email their contact details. This has not happened.

                Support/ after care is awful! Be Warned. Last week I purchased for my home a HP Envy Photo 7830 with 3 years support, and also ordered additional cartridges for when the ones that come with it run out. I followed the setup instructions and installed the cartridges. In the screen it said, cartridge missing. I contacted support and followed their instructions which included updating the printer software. Still same problem. I then tried the two spare cartridges I had purchased. Same problem. Spoke with support via WhatsApp, good idea to use WhatsApp you'd think but they take an age to respond and simple diagnostics take hours. Eventually I was told “I see that the copper contacts are completely removed and there is no nozzle part. Please purchase the new cartridges and it should work fine”. By this time, I’d spent five hours trying different things. Not happy about this as I had two sets of cartridges and had been very careful when installing, but perhaps that was the case. Ordered two more cartridges. Another £30 and guess what same problem. I’m loathed to spend another several hours looking into this, sick of the lack of customer service and just want to return. But told…. I cannot return, I am a consumer and only purchased a week ago and told I could not speak with them on the phone. Also, they will never take back three sets of opened cartridges. They simply don’t care enough to sort the issue; I think the suggestion to order more cartridges was to get rid of me.   5 hours not happy about a simple printer I wanted for my home.

By this time, Iâ€™d spent five hours trying different things. Not happy about this as I had two sets of cartridges and had been very careful when installing, but perhaps that was the case. Ordered two more cartridges. Another Â£30 and guess what same problem. Iâ€™m loathed to spend another several hours looking into this, sick of the lack of customer service and just want to return. But toldâ€¦. I cannot return, I am a consumer and only purchased a week ago and told I could not speak with them on the phone. Also, they will never take back three sets of opened cartridges. They simply donâ€™t care enough to sort the issue; I think the suggestion to order more cartridges was to get rid of me.   5 hours not happy about a simple printer I wanted for my home.

                HP Reverb VR headset Despite HP having issues with the first release and ""fixing "" them I can tell you now that this is not the full truth as Ive had 3 of them. the 1st one suffered from MURA where a large percentage of pixels dont display correctly so you get a looking through slightly dirty glass effect. The other 2 were non functioning. Clearly HP are aware of these faults and choose to use the public as their quality control. I did ask if they could actually carry out quality control before they send a replacement , and was told they were ""unable"" to do this ! I asked for a refund instead. What a shame this could have been the best headset on the market if it works and they had not decided to use that dreadful twin cable that feels like your attached by high voltage cable instead of a cord .  They have also disabled writing product reviews leaving mainly good ones for the Reverb.  Well thats the last time I purchase a HP product ,.

                We purchased a Hewlett packard 2600 all in one printer last June. In general it works okay but the print plan we purchased with it is a sham.  We haven’t had new ink for some time and the company are telling us that this is due to our printer not being connected to the internet. As Most of our printing relates to attachments to emails etc we know that it is connected. The company insist that it must be our broadband provider that is at fault yet we  have no issues otherwise with the broadband reception and as mentioned all our printing from the internet is fine. We are now exasperated with HP and have requested a cancellation of the plan. This was on the 9th February and we have heard nothing in response. We sent two reminders and they have gone unanswered also.  As we all know the measure of a good business is the aftersales service and fixing of problems.  What we are experiencing is the exact opposite of this.   We expect HP to cancel any charges from the cancellation date and perhaps send us some free ink as they haven’t supplied any for months and printing quality is getting very weak.

                How on earth has this company managed to survive with such poor after-sales service is beyond comprehension.  The MS Office software I purchased with my laptop wasn't included in my order. They emailed to say that it was included based on the shipping weight of the package (it wasn't!), effectively accusing me of lying.  They don't work on weekends and are proving impossible to get in touch with to resolve. Avoid HP!! They are bunch of shysters!

                If I could give no stars I would. Bought a new laptop, microsoft office and 3 year care warranty from them. My order arrived just two days later. All seemed great. Then I opened the package containing my Microsoft Office  to find they had sent me the wrong version. Okay, I thought, simple to sort, I'll just get in touch to let them know and soon have my correct item.  Numerous emails, phone calls to call centres based in Asia and a great deal of frustration later and I still have no resolution to my problem.  I have been taken in circles; free phone customer service no. cuts off after 43 seconds without being answered. The chargeable customer service no. surprise, surprise is answered but the call handlers are in a foreign country, cannot be understood and couldn't understand me. They also had no comprehension of the products or services they were supposed to be helping with. The email customer service is no better, different person replying to me each time, when they bother to reply at all. They ask for the same information I have already provided and give me the same stock reply that my query will be dealt with as soon as possible. Which it is not! This company seems to deliberately make it as difficult as possible to get any sort of response from them. They are very quick to take your money though. If things are this bad just over an incorrect item being sent I really don't want to find out how bad things get if anything were to go wrong with the laptop itself.  That is why I have now exercised my legal right to cancel my order and claim a full refund. I will NEVER deal with this company again.

This laptop is not worth £700 I have had laptops that cost £200 that are better than this, the battery life is shocking but more importantly it crashes all the time becomes very slow and also if you force shutdown by holding the power button you will have to wait over 30 mins for the thing to boot up, very disappointing product - I wish i spent a little extra and bought something else - I'm certainly never buying anything from this company again. I see you have terrible reviews here also and i know why, you deserve it.

                Review of HP2630 colour printer and scanner. As a retired professional computer maintenance technician and a qualified and experienced electronics engineer, I have worked in many areas of electronics and with lots of different I.T. equipment. I have seen many HP products over the years, but I am sad to report that over the past ten years or so, the quality of all HP products have steadily declined to the point where HP now produce sheer rubbish: their 2630 printer is a typical example. The driver S/W is totally overblown; the printer will not network over Ethernet; it frequently paper jams; user controls are confusing; ink is expensive; casework is cheap and 'plasticy' and mine recently poured out smoke! So it went into the bin; 2 months from new! Total waste of money. Whatever you do AVOID HP PRODUCTS AT ALL COSTS - utter rubbish. Rating starts? NONE.

                had the free 3 year warranty as part of the purchase price of an HP 6960 printer. 2 years on the print quality has deteriorated, wont print greens or blue. Red and Black are fine. Rang the helpline, he remote accessed my computer and said printers fine and its computer software issues. Wanted to charge me 39.99 to fix the 'Errors'. Refused and logged him off. When I went on other blogs they recommend a photocopy to see if its the printer hardware. Low and behold did a photocopy and its still rubbish. He never thought to ask me to do that just wanted my 39.99. Avoid HP warranty. Not worth a light.  And for the record, signed up to their Instant Ink package so only ever used their cartridges.

                I was considering just giving HP the minimum 1 star....but the phone advisers at their Indian callcentre were so helpful &amp; polite during the 5 or 6 times I had to speak to them, that I've given (specifically) them an extra star. On that subject, I very much doubt that the Indian advisers' real names were ""David"" and ""Kevin"" like they said, but these were in fact pseudonyms given to them by HP in order to try and make UK customers think they were dealing with a Western callcentre/callcentre staff. I can't prove that this is the case, though I'm guessing it's highly probable. If so, it's a really sad state of affairs - patronising, belittling &amp; underhand from the Company, both towards their Indian callcentre staff, and the customers.  Anyway, re my laptop (£469), after 7 months the fan had to be replaced. Then after 10 months, the keyboard had to be replaced (due to a sticky spacebar). First time around, when my laptop was sent away via courier for repair, it was returned to me a week later untouched - baffling! But eventually the repairs were done well - the repair guy, that they sent out to fix my poorly laptop, was top-drawer.   After the 12 months (i.e. the end of the standard 1-year purchase warranty), I bought a new 3-year warranty, only to find out later that the original 1-year warranty was included in the 3-year term. This info was not stated on their website when I purchased the new warranty. In effect then it's a 2-year extended warranty, not a new 3-year one. Their sales guy on the phone also only quoted me a more expensive (engineer call-out) policy, without mentioning that there was also a cheaper (pick-up &amp; return) one available covering the same 3-year period. Fortunately, by sheer luck, I saw the cheaper one online &amp; was able to buy it.  There's no email address available to contact HP. Nor any details of how to complain on their website...which is quite arrogant IMHO. Having dealt with various departments, I get the impression that there's not much communication between them all, often resulting in duplication, confusion &amp; efficiency issues. Some of the emails I sent either just got forwarded to another team, or ignored.  In short then, whilst the performance of the spec of my HP laptop is very decent, I don't think my next laptop purchase will be another HP. At time of purchase, I went for the ""best value"" machine with the spec I wanted; next time I'll probably choose to spend a few more quid on my spec in order to try and get better reliability, transparency &amp; customer service from another maker.

I contacted  HP customer service and the technical department changed the camera confirming it was not right. But when it came back it worked the same. I contacted CS several times, but they just said the (more or less) 600 Euros laptop I have bought was not good enough to have a good camera, and that one is the standard HP camera included.     As I could not believe the answer, I looked for the camera description on the HP website but there is no description, just says HP camera. What is not enough information to offer to a customer to know the product.  I asked to do a formal complaint and the first answer  I received was that my complaint has not validity to be taken into consideration... Finally, after a long time speaking with the agent, he offered me to escalate the situation an call me back if It was accepted. As it is a really surprising method for a CS, and I insisted to have the right to have a proper answer, not just silence, at the end they did.

The system they supplied me has a 3rd party chipset (H310) and Geforce graphics card.The graphics card does not even support any resolution above HD,according to the Geforce specs it should at least support UHD.The specs H.P provide on their website are suspect to say the least. Best to stick with Dell (great service) or contact a smaller company such as Ginger6 (in the UK) you will then get exactly what you have ordered, and the respect you deserve. I obviously did not check Trustpilot before I ordered this rubbish, the other reviews speak volumes.

                I am sick and tired of ordering ink from HP and using it for a few copies and it comes on and says the original HP ink is depleted. Over and over again this happens. Or it comes up and says not an original HP ink. How the hell does that happen when I order it directly from HP?  I would never ever recommend HP again to anyone and how do I get either real ink packs that will make more than 10 copies?  Bet I don't hear from anyone that will make this right with me.

I had a huge ordeal with my computer and your customer service team stayed with me all the way.  It was awesome.  I had an important paper due for my finals and I couldn't get the paper to change form.  Your associates were amazing.  I did everything and It would not work.

                HP printer keeps printing ""alignment"" test pages. This is not an accident. It is the thick greedy people at HP who are wasting your ink deliberately to steal your money. Please don't buy HP products. Make them pay for their deliberate theft!. Also the printer only works over WiFi 50% of the time. I have to keep plugging in the USB and changing Network to USB connection. HP have only had decades to create a fully working printer!

                I was considering just giving HP the minimum 1 star....but the phone advisers at their Indian callcentre were so helpful &amp; polite during the 5 or 6 times I had to speak to them, that I've given (specifically) them an extra star. On that subject, I very much doubt that the Indian advisers' real names were ""David"" and ""Kevin"" like they said, but these were in fact pseudonyms given to them by HP in order to try and make UK customers think they were dealing with a Western callcentre/callcentre staff. I can't prove that this is the case, though I'm guessing it's highly probable. If so, it's a really sad state of affairs - patronising, belittling &amp; underhand from the Company, both towards their Indian callcentre staff, and the customers.  Anyway, re my laptop (£469), after 7 months the fan had to be replaced. Then after 10 months, the keyboard had to be replaced (due to a sticky spacebar). First time around, when my laptop was sent away via courier for repair, it was returned to me a week later untouched - baffling! But eventually the repairs were done well - the repair guy, that they sent out to fix my poorly laptop, was top-drawer.   After the 12 months (i.e. the end of the standard 1-year purchase warranty), I bought a new 3-year warranty, only to find out later that the original 1-year warranty was included in the 3-year term. This info was not stated on their website when I purchased the new warranty. In effect then it's a 2-year extended warranty, not a new 3-year one. Their sales guy on the phone also only quoted me a more expensive (engineer call-out) policy, without mentioning that there was also a cheaper (pick-up &amp; return) one available covering the same 3-year period. Fortunately, by sheer luck, I saw the cheaper one online &amp; was able to buy it.  There's no email address available to contact HP. Nor any details of how to complain on their website...which is quite arrogant IMHO. Having dealt with various departments, I get the impression that there's not much communication between them all, often resulting in duplication, confusion &amp; efficiency issues. Some of the emails I sent either just got forwarded to another team, or ignored.  In short then, whilst the performance of the spec of my HP laptop is very decent, I don't think my next laptop purchase will be another HP. At time of purchase, I went for the ""best value"" machine with the spec I wanted; next time I'll probably choose to spend a few more quid on my spec in order to try and get better reliability, transparency &amp; customer service from another maker.

What is not enough information to offer to a customer to know the product.  I asked to do a formal complaint and the first answer  I received was that my complaint has not validity to be taken into consideration...

                I purchased a HP Officejet Pro 6960 from Currys/PC World and with it HP were offering a free 3 year warranty if you supplied them with the serial number of the machine - which I duly did. They responded by saying they didn't recognise the serial number so couldn't offer a warranty.  After a great of toing and froing they asked that I supplied them with a photograph of the serial number?????? This I duly did and I've heard nothing from them since.  I've been a lifelong user of HP products - but not anymore.  Like a great many large concerns once they have your money then it's thank you and goodbye.  Extremely disappointed.

The system they supplied me has a 3rd party chipset (H310) and Geforce graphics card.The graphics card does not even support any resolution above HD,according to the Geforce specs it should at least support UHD.The specs H.P provide on their website are suspect to say the least. Best to stick with Dell (great service) or contact a smaller company such as Ginger6 (in the UK) you will then get exactly what you have ordered, and the respect you deserve. I obviously did not check Trustpilot before I ordered this rubbish, the other reviews speak volumes. I trusted H.P.because of their long standing reputation and the quality of the previous systems I have purchased from them but be warned best to avoid them at all costs.

                I wish I read some of the earlier reviews! Very impressed with ordering on line and quick delivery. However,after a few days I discovered a fault with the microphone. Tech Support very helpful and after trying several options were unable to correct and advised a replacement was needed. Although their recommendations was passed to the appropriate department I also had to request a replacement using the email address sent to me. Despite 2 emails no response has been received. Feedback has also been responded to with low scores and still waiting. Might try a phone call or failing that request a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  January 2018 update. Eventually I was given permission to return the faulty machine but it took two weeks for it to be collected. Despite reserving a replacement for me, I was subsequently advised the model was out of stock. I had to wait about 2 weeks for the refund during which I ordered another model. I received it just before Christmas and today 4 January 2019 I had an error message that ""it is plugged in and not charging"" Needless to say it is evening time and the phone support is not available until Monday morning.  Since writing this yesterday, I have discovered that this is a Microsoft Windows error that affects other computers including Dell and Lenovo. To readers of my comments (now deleted) and to Hewlett Packard I now apologise for my comments. I still intend to contact HP asap to see if it can be remedied.

HP responded with claim rejected,and again my wife was repeatedly requested to send proof of purchase, this she did on at least two more occasions, HP did NOT RESPOND, Upon checking progress of the claim, it showed CLAIM REJECTED. Upon enquiring elsewhere i find that HP reject the vast majority of claims in respect of cashback. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CON, i now propose to confirm the aforementioned to John Lewis as I suspect that they will not wish to be associated with  such a company ,who make false claims to sell their products

                I recently purchased 2 expensive Elite Book Laptops from Hewlett Packard. They have both had to be returned under warrenty for repairs. The first one returned was a hardware fault with the ethernet port. This was repaired and returned, The hard drive had been reset to factory but didnt cause to much of a problem as nothing was loaded on to the PC as it was new. The second laptop developed a RAM issue and had to be returned for new RAM. Whilst the Laptop was in for repair I recieved constant emails that requests were being made to change my Apple and Amazon acount passwords. When I contacted Apple and Amazon they asked if anyone had access to my email accounts and suggested i changed all passwords. Which i did. As i could not start the Laptop due to the fault i had to give HP the Laptop Username and password, so the only people who had access to my email accounts were HP. coincidence? I contacted HP and asked to speak to customer services and i am still waiting for a reply! When the laptop was returned to me i found the Hard drive had be wiped and Windows 10 re installed without the recovery drive D so not even back to factory, for no reason. I opened an online complaint as i wanted explinations, that was over a week ago still no one has contacted me. You can judge a companys performance when things go wrong, and HP have been genuinely awful. I am self employed and rely on reliable PC, and this incident cost me several days work to get the laptopback to a useable one.

                I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didn’t seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue.   It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time.   I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break. They asked me if I had the laptop in front of me and I said no, explaining that I work during the hours the helpline is open and that I don’t want to bring the laptop to work on a busy train. The technician understood this and gave me some instructions to update the BIOS and perform a system restore when I got home - I did this but it did not resolve my issues. I emailed the technician to tell them it hadn’t worked. In response they tried to ring me a couple of times but I was in work and couldn’t answer and was unable to ring them back after work because the helpline closes at 6pm. They did eventually email instead and asked for a recording of the whirring noise that the laptop was making so that they could try and assess the problem. I was unable to email back with the recording the following day but I did reply the next day. In response to this email, I received an email back stating that my case had been closed.   I contacted HP and had to start the process all over again. This time I tried to resolve the problem over their live chat option, but the technician told me that they couldn’t do anything for me without me having the laptop in front of me. So the next day, I reluctantly took my laptop into work on a busy train into a busy town. On my lunch break I contacted HP again and they remote accessed my laptop and began work on it. As I was using poor WiFi in a coffee shop and had limited time on my break, it was not sufficient time for the work to be completed and the work that was done (updating drivers and deleting temporary folders) still did not resolve the issues. On my way home from work, my bag was knocked off my shoulder at the train station and hit the floor. When I got home, I found that my laptop - that was in a protective case, was badly damaged.  I can appreciate that this was accidental damage and not covered under the product’s warranty but due to the ineffective helpline and inconvenient operating hours they have, I had no choice but to take my laptop into an environment where it was at risk of getting damaged.  When contacting HP again the technician told me I couldn’t talk to a complaints team as my complaint was not valid. The whole customer service experience was appalling and made it very difficult to get issues resolved on a product and ultimately contributed to the subsequent damaged caused. I was told it would cost at least £300 to fix - the laptop cost £480.  I had told the technician, on the original call to them, that the laptop clearly had a hardware issue, as the noise it was making was very loud. I later found out that the technician’s original call notes had said that he believed, from what I had told him, that it was a hardware issue. So surely the laptop should have been arranged to be collected and repaired on the first day I made contact? They however, seemed to do everything they could to avoid this.   In summary: the HP product I bought had multiple issues very soon after buying it, their helpline is ineffective and no use if you work Monday to Friday, and you can’t make a complaint unless THEY decide it’s valid. Avoid HP products.

                They dont like to pick up the phone, thats for sure. 15 minutes so far.Thankyou for your patience message. Whats that mean? That means customer service isn't valued as important to them as it is to customers.  Also the claimback cashback is so convoluted and difficult it makes you wonder if this is done on purpose. If you cannot honour it without the jumping through hoops HP then just dont advertise it, as it really undermines your integrity.You do know there are other company's?

                HP just don't care. I bought HP Pavilion X360 15-br013na Laptop, Intel Pentium, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 15.6” from John Lewis.  After 3 months it developed a problem with a really noisy fan.  I returned it to John Lewis at my own expense and they in turn sent it to HP for repair.  HP advised  that I had damaged the machine and the warranty was void as a result. How is it possible through very light and normal use - opening and closing the lid and turning it on - to damage a machine. I did not damage the laptop. However, neither John Lewis or HP will repair it without charging me. Now I am stuck with a three month old defective laptop - never buy from HP (or John Lewis), They do not deserve consumer trust or custom.

                I am truly astounded by the service I have received from HP.  I called HP regarding my laptop which won't switch on after having the laptop for 1 year 3 months (3 months out of warranty). I was told I would have to pay £300 for a repair even though they don't know what the issue is and I have only owned it for a short period.   When I tried to ask if their laptops were only designed to last one year they just kept repeating the same sentence to me that as it was out of warranty and  I would have to pay £300 to get the laptop fixed. Very rudely when I said I could purchase a brand new one for that amount of money replied 'we could give you a good deal on a new one'.  I then requested to raise a complaint, but was advised I wasn't allowed as I didn't have a valid complaint. I was not allowed to raise a complaint.  When I escalated this and after much argument they provided me with a customer relations email which I was to respond to with my complaint. When I responded with my complaint it bounced back saying the complaint had been closed.  I then called the general number to follow up my email and they advised that the customer services team had called me and told me they had closed my complaint- which they hadn't. Upon investigation they admitted they hadn't called but had closed my complaint as it was 'invalid'.  I asked if the Customer Relations department could call me themselves but was advised they would try to get them to call me but they 'probably wouldn't' and also refused to put their response in writing.   I found it very rude that they didn't advise me via email/ phone or attempt to speak to me in any way before closing the complaint. I have had no response since and the outcome of the complaint was still pay £300 or the laptop will remain broken.   I am truly astounded and disgusted in the service provided by HP. I am a Buyer for a large company and therefore am aware of both the role of Consumer Relations team and their importance as well as the Sale of Goods Act/ Consumer Rights Act which states items must be fit for purpose and of an acceptable quality- my laptop being neither of these things.   I have never owned a laptop that has lasted just over one year and am truly astounded that HP were so rude and unwilling to look in to this for both myself and potential other customers which could be affected.   I will not be recommending HP to anyone else and looking at other reviews many people also feel the same.   In desperate need for improvements in customer service and internal processes.

                I wish I read some of the earlier reviews! Very impressed with ordering on line and quick delivery. However,after a few days I discovered a fault with the microphone. Tech Support very helpful and after trying several options were unable to correct and advised a replacement was needed. Although their recommendations was passed to the appropriate department I also had to request a replacement using the email address sent to me. Despite 2 emails no response has been received. Feedback has also been responded to with low scores and still waiting. Might try a phone call or failing that request a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  January 2018 update. Eventually I was given permission to return the faulty machine but it took two weeks for it to be collected. Despite reserving a replacement for me, I was subsequently advised the model was out of stock. I had to wait about 2 weeks for the refund during which I ordered another model. I received it just before Christmas and today 4 January 2019 I had an error message that ""it is plugged in and not charging"" Needless to say it is evening time and the phone support is not available until Monday morning.  Since writing this yesterday, I have discovered that this is a Microsoft Windows error that affects other computers including Dell and Lenovo. To readers of my comments (now deleted) and to Hewlett Packard I now apologise for my comments. I still intend to contact HP asap to see if it can be remedied. I thought I should delete my critical comments regarding the new computer as soon as possible. I have also increased the * rating.

Whilst the Laptop was in for repair I recieved constant emails that requests were being made to change my Apple and Amazon acount passwords. When I contacted Apple and Amazon they asked if anyone had access to my email accounts and suggested i changed all passwords. Which i did. As i could not start the Laptop due to the fault i had to give HP the Laptop Username and password, so the only people who had access to my email accounts were HP. coincidence?

When the laptop was returned to me i found the Hard drive had be wiped and Windows 10 re installed without the recovery drive D so not even back to factory, for no reason.

                I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didn’t seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue.   It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time.   I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break. They asked me if I had the laptop in front of me and I said no, explaining that I work during the hours the helpline is open and that I don’t want to bring the laptop to work on a busy train. The technician understood this and gave me some instructions to update the BIOS and perform a system restore when I got home - I did this but it did not resolve my issues. I emailed the technician to tell them it hadn’t worked. In response they tried to ring me a couple of times but I was in work and couldn’t answer and was unable to ring them back after work because the helpline closes at 6pm. They did eventually email instead and asked for a recording of the whirring noise that the laptop was making so that they could try and assess the problem. I was unable to email back with the recording the following day but I did reply the next day. In response to this email, I received an email back stating that my case had been closed.   I contacted HP and had to start the process all over again. This time I tried to resolve the problem over their live chat option, but the technician told me that they couldn’t do anything for me without me having the laptop in front of me. So the next day, I reluctantly took my laptop into work on a busy train into a busy town. On my lunch break I contacted HP again and they remote accessed my laptop and began work on it. As I was using poor WiFi in a coffee shop and had limited time on my break, it was not sufficient time for the work to be completed and the work that was done (updating drivers and deleting temporary folders) still did not resolve the issues. On my way home from work, my bag was knocked off my shoulder at the train station and hit the floor. When I got home, I found that my laptop - that was in a protective case, was badly damaged.  I can appreciate that this was accidental damage and not covered under the product’s warranty but due to the ineffective helpline and inconvenient operating hours they have, I had no choice but to take my laptop into an environment where it was at risk of getting damaged.  When contacting HP again the technician told me I couldn’t talk to a complaints team as my complaint was not valid. The whole customer service experience was appalling and made it very difficult to get issues resolved on a product and ultimately contributed to the subsequent damaged caused. I was told it would cost at least £300 to fix - the laptop cost £480.  I had told the technician, on the original call to them, that the laptop clearly had a hardware issue, as the noise it was making was very loud. I later found out that the technician’s original call notes had said that he believed, from what I had told him, that it was a hardware issue. So surely the laptop should have been arranged to be collected and repaired on the first day I made contact? They however, seemed to do everything they could to avoid this.   In summary: the HP product I bought had multiple issues very soon after buying it, their helpline is ineffective and no use if you work Monday to Friday, and you can’t make a complaint unless THEY decide it’s valid. Avoid HP products.

                I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didnâ€™t seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue.   It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time.   I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break.

                They dont like to pick up the phone, thats for sure. 15 minutes so far.Thankyou for your patience message. Whats that mean? That means customer service isn't valued as important to them as it is to customers.  Also the claimback cashback is so convoluted and difficult it makes you wonder if this is done on purpose. If you cannot honour it without the jumping through hoops HP then just dont advertise it, as it really undermines your integrity.You do know there are other company's?

                HP just don't care. I bought HP Pavilion X360 15-br013na Laptop, Intel Pentium, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 15.6” from John Lewis.  After 3 months it developed a problem with a really noisy fan.  I returned it to John Lewis at my own expense and they in turn sent it to HP for repair.  HP advised  that I had damaged the machine and the warranty was void as a result. How is it possible through very light and normal use - opening and closing the lid and turning it on - to damage a machine. I did not damage the laptop. However, neither John Lewis or HP will repair it without charging me. Now I am stuck with a three month old defective laptop - never buy from HP (or John Lewis), They do not deserve consumer trust or custom.

                I am truly astounded by the service I have received from HP.  I called HP regarding my laptop which won't switch on after having the laptop for 1 year 3 months (3 months out of warranty). I was told I would have to pay £300 for a repair even though they don't know what the issue is and I have only owned it for a short period.   When I tried to ask if their laptops were only designed to last one year they just kept repeating the same sentence to me that as it was out of warranty and  I would have to pay £300 to get the laptop fixed. Very rudely when I said I could purchase a brand new one for that amount of money replied 'we could give you a good deal on a new one'.  I then requested to raise a complaint, but was advised I wasn't allowed as I didn't have a valid complaint. I was not allowed to raise a complaint.  When I escalated this and after much argument they provided me with a customer relations email which I was to respond to with my complaint. When I responded with my complaint it bounced back saying the complaint had been closed.  I then called the general number to follow up my email and they advised that the customer services team had called me and told me they had closed my complaint- which they hadn't. Upon investigation they admitted they hadn't called but had closed my complaint as it was 'invalid'.  I asked if the Customer Relations department could call me themselves but was advised they would try to get them to call me but they 'probably wouldn't' and also refused to put their response in writing.   I found it very rude that they didn't advise me via email/ phone or attempt to speak to me in any way before closing the complaint. I have had no response since and the outcome of the complaint was still pay £300 or the laptop will remain broken.   I am truly astounded and disgusted in the service provided by HP. I am a Buyer for a large company and therefore am aware of both the role of Consumer Relations team and their importance as well as the Sale of Goods Act/ Consumer Rights Act which states items must be fit for purpose and of an acceptable quality- my laptop being neither of these things.   I have never owned a laptop that has lasted just over one year and am truly astounded that HP were so rude and unwilling to look in to this for both myself and potential other customers which could be affected.   I will not be recommending HP to anyone else and looking at other reviews many people also feel the same.   In desperate need for improvements in customer service and internal processes.

                Ordered an i5 laptop, confirmed by HP on 17 Apr, at 15:24. A minute later, I was asked to verify my email address. HP website wouldn't accept it. Tried all evening and next morning but no joy. ""Best cancel order"" me thought but that requires logging in to an account; the creation of which may be achieved only after email verification.  Eventually, 18+ hours after placing my order, I was able to verify my email address. Soon afterwards, I received an email to inform me that the order had been shipped. Effectively, by delaying email verification, HP denied me my right to cancel the order before it was shipped. NOT IMPRESSED, so the package will be returned, on principle.  19 Apr. Package arrived during the correct, 1 hr ""window"" and the returns procedure has been completed, online. Hoping for collection on 23 Apr.  UPDATE: Laptop collected, unopened, and full refund received; 10 days after payment. The issue was purely the delay in verifying my email.

                Terrible service from HP. I have a laptop that i purchased an extended warranty directly from their website. Had an issue with my keyboard whilst in warranty which they decided they didn't want to look at and sent me a replacement keyboard. This worked for a while but now has also become faulty and now the manager of technical support Roger Hawk informs me he would like to 'offer' me a paid repair as my warranty ran out a few weeks ago. So they decided to apply a quick, cheap fix whilst in warranty and now that the issue has returned want to charge me to fix the same issue again with no guarantee this fix will last.  Avoid their products as they won't last for long and will force you to keep paying them for short term fixes.

The past 2 laptops I have bought all have issues. 2 it is a wireless card failure, been back to HP who replaced it but it still has issues. The other a graphics problem and wireless card issues. Essentially HP does not want to recognise that they have not got the appropriate drivers for Windows 10 as these laptops were upgraded. Tonnes of people have pointed this out.

                If only I had read the Trustpilot reviews before purchasing from Hewlett Packard, I would have ran for the hills, as the customer service is absolutely deplorable.   My desktop pc arrived on the Friday and was unboxed in the evening. We discovered it was badly damaged, but unfortunately their phone lines were closed for the day and no one works at the weekend.   On Monday, after a long wait to be connected to an advisor. I managed to get the ball rolling in order to get an uplift, which took about a week. As I'm typing this review, I've been on with customer services again, trying to ascertain as to when I'll receive a refund. The young gentleman I spoke to sounded very peed off and demoralised, he's perhaps the figurehead for a company that's in despair.   It's no surprise that Hewlett Packard is in a bad way globally, especially when they can't get their customer service right, as I for one shall not be back.   The item I bought was £950. For a purchase in that price region, I honestly expected much better. Geez, I didn't even get a keyboard and mouse with it.   Overall, take my advice on board and avoid Hewlett Packard.

                Bought Lap top  Reported problems to E Buyer within 30 day period E buyer advised to contact HP By the time I contact HP - its out of the 30 day period Hp will not authorize any replacement/refund as I did not contact them directly within the 30 day period.   Numerous issues detailed in my E Buyer review - E Buyer took lap top back twice - intermittent problems - E buyer advise lap top is working ok - and submit video proof - hardly difficult as the problems were intermittent.... I had also sent video proof of the faults.   Lap top eventually dies in October Returned to HP - Poland - 16 days without lap top. HP do not operate at weekends/lap top box massive - 6 times the depth of my lap top.....  2 days to get to Poland - 7 days to return  Lap top dies again 6 days after being ""repaired""  They offer a home visit - I refuse and want a replacement - no replacement offered - home visit reluctantly agreed (suggested it would be repaired on Friday)- Friday aft - no contact call HP chase......  Visit to be today (Monday).  E mail received at 9.10am stating that this will no longer take place - engineer ""sick""....  Will be repaired next day at my home (first call) - yet another day I have to be available  Sale of Goods act states ""must be repaired/replaced within a reasonable time - without causing significant inconvenience""....   HP have scant regard for customer services.  staff very pleasant - but the chief exec isn't bothered with after sales care and doesn't give them the tools to satisfy its customers - merely pocketing your monies upon sale and then a very polite two finger salute hidden by the ""terms and conditions"" standard response.    Personally I will never get another HP product - and I will have to extend my warranty as I have concerns that it will go again when the 1 year warranty expires - but NOT with HP - "" Mend it"" appear to be a good organisation to extend your warranty.   Update (Tuesday 21st November 2017) - after a missed appointment yesterday (sub contracted firm to HP) - they advised that an engineer would visit as the first visit this morning. 10am nothing - ring - they advise message left for engineer to advise when he would arrive - 11:45am - rang again to chase - spoke to manager who then did manage to speak to engineer - was to arrive at 1pm.   Engineer was very apologetic - but did not know he was first appointment.   Attempted repair - not successful - 3rd motherboard installed so far in this chronic and painful debacle.......   He rings HP ""support"" - after a short discussion on speaker phone, the lady from HP advises to try another motherboard ------- now this is extremely funny you have to say. 3 motherboards go dead, and the solution is to offer up another sacrificial motherboard..... classic.    i, for some reason am not happy with this proposal, so she suggests ""escalation"", which basically means a possible replacement. I wont hold my breath.   I now have to wait another 24 hours until I hear anything - before I need to chase them up again...... 27 days without my lap top.  Shambles

                Their printers are set to print an alignment page every time you switch it on. It is very complicated to stop this and many users complain about wasting time and ink and paper every time the printer is switched on. HP forums are little help.  It is clearly a cynical action to make consumers use more ink. The HP software keeps on popping up offering ink for sale and reward packages! Ink lasts very little time despite limited use. TERRIBLE Ignore any misleading response below. Many customers complain about this but nothing has changed.

                I just bought a laserjet. Could not figure out ""scanning to email"" Called support hotline which you have to pay for per minute: 1) Was told to check the internet - turned out info was wrong 2) Then on second call was cut off the line 3) Then on third call was cut off the line again 4) Then on fourth call was cut off the line again (""all lines busy, call later..., off..."")  Thinking now about giving the printer back - BAD SERVICE !!! This sucks!

                Customer service is so bad I thought the company was based in the US.  Seriously, I really did!  Durr!  Had problems with the 2  HP printers I bought, the one in the spare room has never worked,(3055A) contacted HP for help numerous  times, they did try and help!  Didn't offer a refund but were prepared to sell me another.  Ended up buying a new printer from them - i was desperate!  Living in a very rural area I can't pop into a neighbour let alone a store!  Have to do all my own copies when needed!  Wouldn't recommend HP unless your a bright young thing and can go it alone.  I'm 73 and find it a struggle!  I have been happy with the HP lap top I have, got a lot of click here to get help, on it!  Not like being able to speak to someone.

                HP customer service support is difficult to navigate, does not communicate with its customers and after a frustrating 6 weeks trying to solve a printer problem, I have given up and have bought another printer...needless to say it's not an HP printer and I will never buy another HP product as I know that if there is a problem, it won't get sorted!

                Just bought a laptop from HP, they have taken the money from my account and they've sent me the confirmation email.  All good. Then an hour later, I received another email that my order was cancelled for no apparent reason. I have called the customer service twice and apparently they cannot help me out, because they cannot see my order in the system even though the money is missing from my account. Too bad because I really wanted that laptop, but  this has been a very disappointing experience. Hope I will get my money back soon, so I can look for a new laptop elsewhere. Also want to point out that one of the customer service agents told me ""call us back after 5:30 PM"" which is actually when the lines are closing for the day. Great customer service Hewlett-Packard!!

                Bought an HP laptop two years ago. The laptop  Broke down twice during the warranty period, there was a problem with the hard drive. HP repaired the system on both occasions. Now  the warranty period is over, the keyboard has stopped working.  Avoid HP at all costs.

                I bought the HP wireless printer about 18 months ago.  Sometimes I used HP cartridges but sometimes alternatives like Asda.  I came back from holiday to find that my printer (with Asda cartridge) would no longer work. To my surprise I discovered that HP have a facility to disable my printer if alternative cartridges are inserted and to my horror they had actually used this facility.  Talk about ""Big Brother is watching you"".  The outcome of this is that I will never buy another HP product and I'm replacing my printer immediately.   This type of action by any Company is totally unacceptable when customers have paid good money for a product.

                My HP laptop is a few months old.  When the keyboard malfunctioned recently my regular tech support company told me it would take 3 or 4 weeks to source a new one and 10 mins to fit it. Reluctantly I contacted HP  who said they needed the whole laptop back and would arrange pick up from a courier. Anyone who has ever dealt with dpd will know they are a disaster - communication skills of a baboon.  It took dpd 3 days to contact me and I had to go to the depot twice to sort out pick up.  That was 13 days ago and in the last 3 days I have received 3 contradictory messages from HP about the status of my laptop.  I phoned three times but didn't get confirmation of anything really - but they are really good at reading screens and telling you what you have already told them. Very pleasant to deal with but they couldn't understand some of what I was saying and I had to repeat and correct things quite a lot. I got home yesterday and found a dpd 'sorry i missed you' note on the mat.  This despite the fact I have their app on my iPhone telling me no delivery was due.  I have to go back up to the depot now and goodness knows what's next ... all for 10 mins to replace a flipping keyboard. There must be an easier way to do things.

                Really excited to get a new PC and recommended by a nephew who works for HP.  Within one week the product had frozen and would not work at all.  I contacted HP and was only able to talk to a rep in India - no disrespect to them, but this was absolutely useless.  I explained the situation; was told that I would have to return the brand new product to them (which would take 14 days to set up) and that there was no guarantee that they would deal with the problem.  I use this product for my small business and was SO disappointed.  I have since had an email back to say that they would issue a returns authorisaton form (DOA) - does this mean 'Dead On Arrival'?!! - which 'would entitle me to an exchange at your point of sale'.  Fortunately I have a really good technician who had set up my system for me and he suggested leaving the notebook on the docking station for 24 hours.  Miraculously this worked and my notebook came back to life again.  It took HP Customer Relations Specialist 11 days to respond with a reply to my problem - by which time I needed to do all sorts of business operations e.g. VAT return, CIS return, pickup business emails etc. What a shambles.  SO disappointed with after sales and the fact that I was unable to talk to someone in UK.  I bought UK product and would expect to be at least able to talk to someone about it.

                After my grandparents generously decided to give me a printer for university I was over the moon as I could not afford one myself. They even bought me the best one on the market - the HP officejet Pro 6830. I don't think any money has been spent any worse than on this particular printer. Not only would it never connect to my internet but the costumer service was horrendous too and basically blamed my internet provider for the issues. My internet providers ended up trying to guide me in how the printer works (as the fault was not on their side) but with no luck. So I went out and spent money on a wire so I could connect it my Macbook directly to my computer but it still does not work.  I would never ever ever recommend anyone to ever buy a HP printer. And if they might consider it I will do my very best to warn them as they might end up spending over 1,5hrs trying to sort out the bloody printer just to print a single page. Every single time you need to print.

                I bought a HP Laptop about 3 years ago, and the Windows 10 updates have caused me massive issues. In their wisdom, HP have decided not to provide device updates for windows 10 for anyone who has purchased their products prior to Aug 2013.  Absolute crap, and no doubt a ploy to get people to buy their products.  I can't afford a new laptop so I attempted to recover 8.1 with the disks that came with the Laptop instead.  Disks do not work, which I didn't realise, and would not have realised before trying to use them to recover.  I have a license which extends to whenever Windows 8.1 goes on, - which is years.  Can't get hold of anyone at HP and when I have sent them an e-mail, I have received a standard response saying my 1 year warranty has expired.  Well there is a law called 'sale of goods act 1979' that applies to my purchase up until 5 years afterwards.  So I'm going down that road now.   We have allowed a culture with technology to evolve whereby we just accept things as they are.  Poor CS, poor products and shafted into getting new products to line these people's already full to the brim pockets. Absolute crap.

                In November 2015 I purchased a new laptop off the line at HP, the 15-ak011na. I got BSoDs from nearly day one, random input from the keyboard and mouse, and just poor quality functioning from the outset - it was noisy, it would freeze all the time, and just generally didn't function as well as it should given that it's got some pretty powerful hardware in it.  After a lot of hassle with the tech support team, the laptop was taken away for repair, which I was told was to be completed within 10 days. However, a month later and the team had had my laptop for as long as I had owned it myself, with no sign of it actually coming back for another few weeks. Desperately needing it for University, I took some extra measures which eventually got me a new laptop, compensated by a better model for my hassle. This is great, and the HP store guys are really friendly and lovely, but the tech are a nightmare, on top of the outright poor build of at least this line of laptops.  My replacement was a 15 ak116na, a more powerful laptop of the same line. However, very quickly I was faced with the same problems. Similar BSoDs, random input from the mouse and keyboard, and slightly disturbing noises from the laptop got me to call tech again. They ran a 'scan' (one which I knew myself would do literally nothing to actually fix the laptop), which they assured me would work, but otherwise I'd have to reinstall the OS (which to me seems ridiculous when I order a pre-built laptop! It should come working!). Evidently, the fix didn't work, I did some of my own tests, couldn't find anything, and then called up again when I got very frequent BSoDs. The man on the phone told me we'd have to reinstall the OS, and when we went to do it, the recovery files and executions which should have allowed it were missing. I was told I'd be shipped the files and have to do it later.  This is just getting ridiculous. I shouldn't have to be sent two laptops that aren't working and have to make them functional myself. Considering everything that happened the last time, it would have been nice to have had a little bit of consideration from the team (who have all been told about the situation every time I've called). Still no fix and it's starting to take a toll on my grades. Sick of this! I wouldn't buy again.

                Ok, first of all, I have to have empathy for people with poor reviews.  I understand companies like HP are generally useless as customer service.  In fact getting ahold of them is a nightmere, they need to have clearer contacts.  I have a very nice printer, £500ish, that I purchased from Staples.  After very little use and 18 months its gave me an error message. I took it to staples who told me it was cheaper to buy a new one even though this one was basically brand new.  I contacted HP and explained the situation, not really expecting much of a response.    I was called by a person in their contact centre who said they would replace the machine for me with a refurbished machine.  When it arrived it was as good as brand new, all wrapped up etc... and they included £200 worth of full ink.    If more larger companies started to understand that when they treat customers like this we will purchase from them again, I certainly will.  In this case I have to give a big thumbs up to HP and their customer service!  Paul Rhodes  Seven Institute

                It's a sad old world we live in now. The more I choose to contract with these corporations, the more I lose the will to live.  Recently purchased an HP Envy laptop on Amazon, apparently new. Upon arrival, item certainly appeared to be brand new with box, packaging and usual screen protectors etc in place. Also purchased, independent of HP, an m-SATA SSD drive. This installed and was recognised fine by the laptop. I then did a fresh install of Windows 10, onto the SSD, re-using the same license from Windows 8.1 that came with the laptop, pre-installed on the internal 1TB spindle hard drive. Before installing Windows 10, I also performed essential BIOS updates, using and as recommended by the main HP website.  All was good until the laptop started reporting a smart fault with the hard drive that was in it. I took note of the smart ID as presented to me on the screen, and performed necessary BIOS checks on the drive as it recommended. This did not rectify the issue. In the end, I physically removed the drive as it was causing an error to appear upon every boot and was also preventing (for what ever reason) the laptop from booting from the SSD I had now installed, thus preventing the continued setup of Windows 10.  Laptop now runs fine with the original spindle hard disk removed (which is, I suppose, a bonus because it is now quieter and means battery lasts longer). So I contacted HP support to arrange replacement of this drive. I should also say that upon removing the drive, it didn't look new and had some strange scuff marks on the circular spindle drive cover on the underside. After a whole polava with HP support, they finally agreed to accept return of the drive. Or so I thought (I knew this was too good to be true).  Hard drive was collected. 7 days later, they returned the exact same drive back to me. When I questioned why, they said they needed the entire laptop back, even though it is working fine now with the SSD installed, even though I clearly provided them a smart ID failure code for the hard drive, as presented to me by the laptop itself.  I've now written this issue off. There are more important things in life than to be dealing with c**p like this, and as a woman said in a restaurant once in a video that went viral, HP need to get this s**t right the first time, or not at all. You get it right the first time, that's what customer service is about. But so many of these corporations are in it for nothing more than the money and lining their pockets with profits.  Not a good experience, and unlikely to purchase another HP product again. All they had to do was test the drive, like any other normal company would do, but they didn't. They wanted the entire laptop back. No tolerance for this s**t any more I'm afraid HP. Get a grip, fast. Over and out.

                We have bought many PCs, laptops and printers over the last 20 years and have spent thousands of pounds with Hewlett Packard either directly or through a third party.  Obviously we have been happy in the past because we have purchased so many products. We bought a replacement printer in January (after HP sales recommendation). This gave us problems and we replaced it (again after HP recommendation). But although customer services had promised to refund us, once I had bought the replacement I could not get any response from them. HP just don't bother to call back or email back. I have asked for my emails to be passed to the CEO but still no response. I can see from the other comments that HP customer service is not what it was and they don't seem to care about their reputation.  I have spoken to staff representing HP who have been rude and brusque. We are due to buy 2 PCs and I must admit this has definitely put us off. Do HP not realise that good customer service ensures more sales in the long run?

This year I have just bought a new laptop and a new printer, both separate days, both had cashback offers advertised at the point of sale in john Lewis.  Having tried to claim the cashback its obvious it just a scam and they will try all options not to pay, the first one I have been told it was bought at the wrong time!! the second one by the time they looked at the request the claim was in the wrong time window.  will not use again and this is not the sort of scam you would expect from a large well known company.

                Finding myself needing a new printer in February 2015 I looked at a number of makes and models, amongst which I liked most a Hewlett Packard one but it was a bit over my budget. However, I found mention of a £40 Cashback offer if I bought direct from HP, although there was conflicting information online as to when the offer ended. Some pages said 31 January, some said 30 April.  At this point the complexities of dealing with HP should have warned me off them. If you look for information on their web pages you find yourself going round and round in circles, likewise if you try to find out how to contact them. Eventually I found a suitable phone number whose operative confirmed the offer had been extended to 30 April, and I was given another number to call for re-confirmation.   I ordered the HP printer as it was now more affordable to me. Delivery was prompt, and I heeded the advice to register it, doing this the following day. No invoice was received, I had to email HP to ask for one, and there was no further information about the Cashback, but I felt sure I would be contacted. When this did not happen, I uneasily searched again for information online, where I found nothing concrete, just vague suggestions that one had up to 60 days to claim.   Eventually I started sending emails of enquiry to HP, the replies to these always directed me to different departments until one day I was given the phone number for printer cashback, where a man told me I should have registered for the Cashback. The one I had completed was just to register the product, it seems. This was news to me, but there was little response to my remark that my psychic powers must have deserted me. (I must add here that I have not spoken to anyone on a HP phone number whose first language was English.)  Following his advice, I emailed full details which,  I was told, would be presented to the head of department for consideration. By return of email 5 days later, I was informed there were ""rules and regulations to the promotion"" as detailed in an attached 5-page pdf of T&amp;Cs, and I had not met the terms of contract as I was now outside the registration period. My further email of protest has not been replied to, they appear to have chosen to ignore it.  So don't be taken in by any such offer, take the higher price as being what the goods will cost you, for it is my opinion that these crooks HP intentionally set out to make it as difficult as possible for you to get any Cashback.

Called a second time and waited 28 minutes to speak to someone, was told to turn it off for 30 minutes to reset it and it would work... This didn't...  Called a third time today, still on hold waiting to speak to someone, currently on hold for 1 hour 8 minutes. Do they really call this customer service?

                Excellent service. The booking process was easy. I was advised of the time window in which the engineer would arrive. He actually arrived slightly before that window but that was not an issue. He worked for over an hour to fix the problem. Left everything clean and tidy and my washing machine working again! All whilst exercising social distancing. Great job! Thank you.

                Excellent service despite covid circumstances. Telephone advisor was so helpful and reassuring and the washing machine engineer came prepared with his PPE mask and fresh new gloves for each visit, 2m apart and kindly advised me to wipe down any surfaces after he left. The engineer also called me beforehand his arrival advising indicated time and discussed potential issues and what he could realistically fix with his spare parts. He also fixed the washer in seconds. Only slight improvement I would suggest from Hoover would be receiving 2hour time slot text for engineer I was expecting that never arrived, but given current circumstances that's understandable and after a quick call to Hoover they were able tell me a rough estimate.

                I purchased a Hoover washing machine from AO.com at the end of March 2019. Model HBWD8514D-80.  The function of the product was fine until yesterday when during a wash, the main drum seal tore. After speaking with customer service and then via the action desk - outlining the product was only weeks out of warranty, I was surprised to be told that the warranty had expired so I would need to pay £129 for a repair, or could purchase £200 of insurance for the next year. Now I understand a warranty is a contract on the terms of purchase, but you do hope a company would stand by the quality of their products with a little more authority. I couldn't recommend any white good of this sort that fails weeks beyond a 12 month guarantee with a minimum of £129 additional cost to be incurred.

                I purchased a Hoover washing machine from AO.com at the end of March 2019. Model HBWD8514D-80.  The function of the product was fine until yesterday when during a wash, the main drum seal tore. After speaking with customer service and then via the action desk - outlining the product was only weeks out of warranty, I was surprised to be told that the warranty had expired so I would need to pay Â£129 for a repair, or could purchase Â£200 of insurance for the next year. Now I understand a warranty is a contract on the terms of purchase, but you do hope a company would stand by the quality of their products with a little more authority. I couldn't recommend any white good of this sort that fails weeks beyond a 12 month guarantee with a minimum of Â£129 additional cost to be incurred.

                Came to fix their washing machine which has repeatedly broken to be fair with heavy use over the last few years. Last guy who came out could not put the washing back under units so now is left pulled out. I have chased for months with no call backs -  now they refuse to fix even though they caused the problem. I think avoid.

                I’d give it NO STARS or MINUS STARS if I could. This is the most useless and stupid cacophony of cheap plastic I have ever come across. I think it picks up dust by creating static electricity. It is horrible to use (and to look at). Emptying it is a dusty nightmare. Honestly, I am rue the day I bought this. I hate it.

                When the engineer left there was no demonstration that the appliance had been fixed and when I went to try the appliance there was blood splatters on the rubber seal, the front/door , sides back and top of the appliance. When I had carefully cleaned this off and switched the appliance on, the grating, squealing noise was terrible. I contacted the help line who could only offer another engineer visit the following week.

It carried on doing it so did a second call out the second engineer walked in I showed her what was happening.

                Service engineer was very professional and attempted to improve the machine, he told me to monitor the situation. Problem with the Hoover DHL Link washing machine has been worse ever since and it was only a month old when he came out. Absolutely the worst washing machine I have ever had in my many years of ownership, I am sticking to all the manual instructions (which frankly I did not have to with my old washing machine which lasted years). I am currently running this 9kg one on a half load programme (engineer recommended full, but honestly shakes so hard on a full cotton load it is scary to watch and listen to). He said the drum movement when the machine is not on was normal (it sways a bit), not sure I believe this based on my previous machines - if it is normal, it is a huge design flaw, the machine actually shakes and when on a high spin, the kitchen vibrates - not good!!!

                Engineer did not turn up on appointed day but customer services went the extra mile to ensure an engineer arrived the very next day. He had travelled many miles to be with us which was a great relief to have the machine back up and running. It was under a 10 Yr guarantee but I needed to take out a 12 month Dom &amp; Gen cover which I had not budgeted for out of our 2 reduced pensions. 10 Yr guarantee would still have cost £129 to get repair done so it ended up a costly repair as I had chosen machine over other brands because of 10yr guarantee.

                Service engineer was very professional and attempted to improve the machine, he told me to monitor the situation. Problem with the Hoover DHL Link washing machine has been worse ever since and it was only a month old when he came out. Absolutely the worst washing machine I have ever had in my many years of ownership, I am sticking to all the manual instructions (which frankly I did not have to with my old washing machine which lasted years). I am currently running this 9kg one on a half load programme (engineer recommended full, but honestly shakes so hard on a full cotton load it is scary to watch and listen to). He said the drum movement when the machine is not on was normal (it sways a bit), not sure I believe this based on my previous machines - if it is normal, it is a huge design flaw, the machine actually shakes and when on a high spin, the kitchen vibrates - not good!!!

                When our service visit was booked, we were asked if we would accept a service visit at short notice, as a cancellation or re-scheduling.  Two days later, I received a phone call from the service engineer to ask if he could visit early the next day, sometime after 7.15. Sure enough, he arrived at 7.35 the next morning, before the text notifying me of the revised appointment time had reached my phone. The service engineer was punctual, efficient, pleasant  and polite. The washing machine was fixed very quickly, and there have been no problems since, so a very positive experience worth five stars.

                If I could leave 0 stars I would. I have never experienced anything like it. I totally appreciate the difficulties with the current Covid-19 situation, however, do you feel it is acceptable to leave a broken washing machine for 3 weeks? I have a 5 week old baby who I am unable to dress in clean clothes. I have a key working partner who has now been laid off due to being unable to attend work in clean uniform as this goes against their covid 19 policy. I am unable to use a laundrette as none are open and cannot visit elderly, vulnerable relatives to launder my clothes due to the risk of the virus. I have received a phone call from your engineer this morning explaining that she cannot come due to no part, however, the engineer last week told me it was in the warehouse ready. Explain that? Also, as mentioned previously, we are now financially being affected by this as my partner is not working as a result.  Can I also mention that this is not an old washing machine, it was only 364 days old when it broke, yes, 1 day before the warranty ended...the drum has completely come off and sheared all the plastic inside. Good product?! I doubt it. I pay for domestic and general appliance insurance and they cannot help due to being within the manufactures warranty. I cannot wait for another repair and risk the same problem.  For safety and hygiene reasons, I need a new machine. This is causing unnecessary stress to what is already a very difficult time to bring a new baby into a global pandemic.

                The 10yr Warranty is the biggest Con! You wait untill you buy your machine and register! It Costs A Fortune.  Problems - nearly 2yr old washing machine. Printed circuit board is buzzing and crackling and trips it out.  - 4 month old tumble dryer, make a huge thumping noise!! Was told that's normal. dries the second time it goes in, even if it's barely damp to begin with. Door latch is week and door easily pops open and stops the machine.  A year down the line we have 2 faulty appliances and the guarantee calls get pushed around. So I phone the number to call on the washing machine and tumble dryer, eventually get put through to someone at vacuums that can't help.  The idea of saving a few quid using HOOVER is a bad move... It's not worth it and will cost you more to keep

This time I get a bit of steam and it’s spitting out so much water that my floors are soaking! Have hoover changed the model of this mop as I had one for years before and never had this issue. Please can you arrange for someone to collect the item and refund me as I don’t want this hassle anymore. I don’t trust any of your products or brand and feel very disappointed. Do not purchase.

I had a very helpful reply from Peter at Hoover who asked for my details which I forwarded to him. no response whatsoever, perhaps Hoover know there is an ongoing problem and choose to ignore it. I am now looking to buy another make rather than another battery

                The engineer turned up within the allocated time to repair our brand new unused HTDBW H7A1TCE Integrated Heat Pump Tumble Dryer. He identified the problem as three ridges on the front perimeter of the drum. He said that he thought this had been caused by the product being dropped in transit. He hammered out the drum ridges and made the machine a lot quieter but in the end Hoover decided to authorise a replacement. The replacement came and this had exactly the same problem but the control panel was not properly affixed to the machine and was loose. The retailer decided to replace the product this time and sent us another replacement. Dryer number 3 arrived and this had a sticker on the box saying ""Quality Checked"". This was the best of the three machines but still had kinks in the drum perimeter but was less noisy than the previous two machines. We have decided to keep this machine as it is such an inconvenience having the machine replaced. It would appear that the quality control and the build quality is the real problem with this model. As for the dryer itself, if you can get a good build it is a really good machine and the hoover service engineer was really good and quick to attend.

                The engineer was excellent. It is fortunate that Hoover have such a dependable backup team. Our machine was under 2 weeks old. It had never worked properly and the engineer declared the control panel defective within minutes of arriving. So, Engineer = excellent, but Hoover Tumble dryer = £500 wasted (chosen for its alleged WiFi capability to extend drying cycles remotely but, like the machine itself, simply does not work).  If you like to be bitterly disappointed and to waste your hard-earned money, then this could be just the tumble dryer you are looking for.

                The engineer was excellent. It is fortunate that Hoover have such a dependable backup team. Our machine was under 2 weeks old. It had never worked properly and the engineer declared the control panel defective within minutes of arriving. So, Engineer = excellent, but Hoover Tumble dryer = £500 wasted (chosen for its alleged WiFi capability to extend drying cycles remotely but, like the machine itself, simply does not work).  If you like to be bitterly disappointed and to waste your hard-earned money, then this could be just the tumble dryer you are looking for.

                Just had an Engineer out to replace the drum on my tumble dryer, when he had finished he told me he couldn't take the old drum away and just left this huge drum in the middle of the ktchen floor. Can you tell me where in the Terms and Conditions it states that the disposal of replaced parts is my responsibility?

                Hoover Dynamic Next Washer Dryer is a very unreliable appliance. It made my life hell since I bought this washer dryer. Always some sort of problem arises one after another.

                The Hoover Dynamic Next Washer Dryer is an incredibly unreliable appliance. When you buy a washing machine you expect it to be the back bone of your house, an appliance you can count on to keep you at your best. Previous washing machines I have had have given me 10 years of service with out problems. This one unfortunately comes with what feels like a subscription repair service amounting to about 100 euro a year. In just under two years this washing machine has turned from a 400 euro machine into a 600 euro machine and I can only assume the cost will rise as the years go on. After multiple costly breakdowns Hoover have not accepted that it is a fault in the individual machine and offered to replace it therefore I can only assume it is a fault in the line as a whole line. Do Not Buy. I will be cutting my losses and looking for something else.

Plus points is the design looks very good but the suction is  poor and it doesn't pick anything up it only moves it around.The product is top heavy and if not secured to the bracket supplied its in danger of falling over and breaking. The engineering team must have been on holiday when this product got passed that's a £100 plus I will not be getting back so I won't be buying any more Hoover products in the future. I thought Hoover was a Good Branded Name but not anymore.   Sorry Hoover

                Terrible customer service and products. I have a dynamic Hoover washer/dryer. - Do not buy! First off the dryer function has never worked properly- Low temp doesn't dry even with minimal clothes in it &amp; high temps scorch and shrinks clothes. I forgave that knowing washer/dryers aren't perfect and its a waste of electricity anyway so wouldn't want to be using all the time. Then it started making noises which got progressively louder over a few washes, an error message came up and stopped the machine from working. I called the retailer and they contacted hoover to send an engineer out at no cost to me. Engineer came out and was to be fair very quick and clean repairing the issue which was loose bolts holding the drum in place.  Now 5 months after the first repair the washing machine started to make an almighty banging sound (louder than ever before with loose bolts) midway into a wash. This time no error message came up and it continued to stay on causing more damage as it spun around. I had to turn off the machine by hand once it was noticed. This is the part that worried me the most. Once I opened the door (after it unlocked) you could clearly see the drum had fallen out of place and the rubber on the edges had started to come off in some sections.  My issue here is that the machine had no auto turn off system after the entire drum had fallen out of place with water still in it and the electrics still running which in my mind is a fire hazard if it had a chance to flood. I do not feel comfortable repairing the same machine again and would only expect a full replacement especially as this is not the first time I've had an issue with the machine. I explained this all to a Hoover customer service rep who said I would have to pay for the repair this time. I said that was not acceptable and she said there was nothing Hoover could do except get me to pay for the repair. I said this issue is clearly on going and more dangerous and severe than last time. She then said ""well it has worked for the 5 months after the repair work so there's nothing else we can do"". I would have no problem paying for repair if it was a completely separate issue, but it is the same drum issue but much more serve and dangerous now as the machine didn't auto turn off this time. I have lost all confidence with this hoover machine.  EDIT- They do not respond to the email outlined below. It seems like the response below is just for show. I'm going to move to another brand such as BOSCH as they have a much longer warranty and reviews look overall better. I hope this helps other consumers out there.

                ORDER ONLINE AT YOUR PERIL. The website says UK, the website is in English.  However once you order you become captive audience.  Hoover is a front for third party companies and deliveries based in Italy and the finance link is to another third party company.  The wheels of delivery move very slowly as they now have your money and only then do they say the item is being delivered from Italy.  I rang there HOOVER hotline only to be told to email the third party company in Italy.  They lack transparency on their website, makes you wonder how good their products are.

                I purchased my Hoover Dynamic Next 8kg washer dry from John Lewis last year.  From day one the drying function was over heating and scorching my clothes, in addition to excessive vibration (had multiple machines in its place prior not making noise, flat floor, 'perfect' for washing machine to go on) it pulled my cupboards away from counter and vibrated shelf off the wall caused damage to lots of crockery, broken glasses and the cost of a handy man to re hang my shelf.  I called the call centre who were not helpful and asked me to speak to John Lewis, I then called Hoover back as Joh Lewis said the repairs are nothing to do with them.  The repair man came who said there was nothing wrong with it and told me how all machines these days are cheap and have a spring loaded mechanism with cause them to vibrate also. I explained how upset I was, he told me to call the call center and 'threaten them with social media 'n' all that' for your money back. He did a test on his phone and showed me there were no errors, i tried to explain how why a machine would tell him it is faulty when it thinks it is performing correctly, he didn’t have a reply. I was never informed of a charge and was subsequently charged £65.00 for this visit.  I was them visited by the area manager, who said there was nothing wrong with the machine but proceeded to replace the thermostat and motherboard.  Once this was fitted it worked perfectly for 3 washed until another issue which only happened sometimes since day one then happened each and every time, whenever it would get to 3 minutes it would increase the time, fill up and spin again. It repeated to do this for 3 hours! when i realized it was clearly a fault and turned off the machine. Although I was assured I would not be billed for any of the visits, I then received another bill for £65 which I had to phone up and spend an hour on the phone sorting.  The repair man came out, the same one as the first time despite telling the call centre I felt threatened when he was in my home. He did a test on his phone to which he said it was 'done in' called a lady on the phone and said 'i was doing really well today wasn't I' he left my house without saying goodbye and didn't remove his aviator sunglasses the entire time. I think he might have hated me because I complained about him perhaps.  A different repair man came to fir a new motherboard, he managed to fit and test it in 15 minutes which is either efficient or slap dash but he was very friendly.  Since 3 days ago when it was 'fixed' the machine gets to 11 minutes, then increases the time to 16 minutes, fills, drains then spins. This was repeated 13 times over the course of an hour or so before i turned it off. The spin and drain function gets to one minute and continuously spins faster and faster and broke my kitchen cabinets I had previously paid to be fixed due to this machine. The vibration has returned to being as bad as when I first got it, as if the machines sensor for weight it broken as I was told by the manager who came to fix to only use the long wash cycles as the fast ones just spin regardless. I have followed this advice since.  I sincerely think my washing machine is not fit for purpose. I called Hoover today in tears and spoke to a really nice lady called Nicky who is forwarding my issue to the 'Resolutions Team' who will be in touch sometime next week.  I am disabled and receive PIP payments of which I saved up to buy this machine, since receiving this machine I have not had one successful wash and have taken to washing my clothes in the bath as I am frightened of it. Since buying this machine, I have had to spend my disability payments on getting my laundry done with had amounted to around £112 a month to which I receive about £200 a month in PIP payments. I have told Hoover this many times but there is no empathy. The lino in the kitchen is torn badly from being dragged out so many times, landlord will make me pay for this.  ***UPDATE*** Since then I have received emails asking me to confirm yet another engineer appointment to which they have confirmed I might be liable for a further fee.  I have then asked to speak to the customer resolutions team as promised on the phone AND IN THE MESSAGE FROM HOOVER BELOW however I was told that this was not possible and I have to call the main line to which they 'may' be able to transfer me Peter from Hoover states.  I have since asked for him to find out the case handler in that team and ask them to call me directly or email me with a number to call them straight back on if they do not currently have the facility.  My situation isn't being sorted out at all and they are just pushing me around in circles yet again.  I have now contacted the CEO and partners of John Lewis and Hoover to await a response

                Good prompt service from Hoover engineer. The only thing I’d say is that he moaned about lack of lighting in my utility room. A couple of bulbs had gone and in the current situation hadn’t had a chance to replace them. He mentioned the lighting a few times, which was unnecessary and unprofessional. Let’s be honest he could have used a torch.

I let them in and they were lovely I left them alone in the living room due to the social distancing .. they was only coming to sort the bearings, but instead they took their time and stripped the whole tumble drier and fixed everything that needed doing went above and beyond so I didnt need another call out, my tumble drier now works better then when I got it new .. so thankyou Phil and John for all your work even in these testing times you stayed an completed the job to high standard.

                Everything fixed and ok, one small gripe is that when I booked the repair I was asked what I thought the fault was , i told them the fan was noisy. Guess what the engineer came out , it was the fan, had he  not got one with him.In these times where social distancing is key it would have saved us all a lot of hassle.

                So had problems with my tumble drier since I got it ... had one man come out twice and forgot parts or said wasnt ordered so ended up waiting 2 months for it to be fixed in the end.. so yesterday had 2 guys turn up but I woke up late as I didnt see the 7am message ... I let them in and they were lovely I left them alone in the living room due to the social distancing .. they was only coming to sort the bearings, but instead they took their time and stripped the whole tumble drier and fixed everything that needed doing went above and beyond so I didnt need another call out, my tumble drier now works better then when I got it new .. so thankyou Phil and John for all your work even in these testing times you stayed an completed the job to high standard.

                I have owned Hoover washing machines since I left the comfort of my parents house in 1981. The first machine lasted 25 years, brilliant machine. My next Hoover only lasted 13 years, still good in my opinion. Alas my latest one, a 9kg Link is very disappointing. The daily 59 programme, the one I used most on the old machine is strange. On a 30 degrees wash the clothes come out warm (I have only the cold feed connected). This indicates to me that they arent being rinsed enough, so I have to put them on a extra rinse and spin at the end of the programme. The machine sometimes bounces all over the floor when on spin, despite me trying different size loads. This means I dare not leave the room until the wash is finished. And to top it all off the time remaining indicator is unreliable, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes disappears without reason. It will be interesting to see how long this machine lasts, providing I dont hit it with the hammer in frustration.

                Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. I’ve never been treated that bad before. An engineer came to see my washing machine and tell me what’s the problem, I ordered a broken part through him, payed £129 for it to the engineer who told me the prt will arrive in 5 working days. One and a half month later the part still hasn’t arrived, and every time I call them they pass me from one person to another and nobody knows where my part is. They are all rude, and they offered me a 50% refund after one and a half month of waiting ! I’ll throw away their useless machine and go buy a product from a decent company.

                Hoover have responded, not very helpfully, to my review and have referred me to the retailer!  Bearing in mind this is a Hoover products why should the retailer (Curry's) have to bear the brunt.  I recently bought a Hoover Optimum Power Allergy &amp; Pets OP30ALG - 001- 39001622 and I can say it is possibly the worst piece of kit I've ever had the misfortune to use.  It has absolutely no suction power whatsoever, it rolls rolls hair and fluff backwards and forwards without ever picking it up (it has a 'Pet Hair' attachment which is also laughable).  Even on linoleum and hardwood floors it struggles and I've reverted to a broom until my new vacuum cleaner arrives!  I've persevered with it but am absolutely furious that this could be sold in Curry's as a sensible piece of electrical equipment - it's an absolute joke and I'm not sure what the hell Hoover engineers were thinking of.  I'd like to take it back to Curry's but in the present circumstances this is not going to be possible and by the time we're allowed out again I will no doubt be told that i should have returned it sooner!

                I am 100000% certain these r refurbished machines in no way is it possible for a machine to break down so quickly. I’ve  had my fair share of budget Washing machines over the years But I have never encountered this many problems with one company/machine  it’s not even been two washes since I begged them to give me a replacement after the first one broke down after maybe 5 washes and now it’s not working it’s just not working. In all the budget washing machines I’ve purchased I’ve never ever had one break down. If a review is ever worth trusting this is the review that will save you money, time and will save you from having a mental breakdown. Stay far away from hoover

                Happy with repair, but he left machine on an uneven surface, so wobbled and the machine could not be put on as it wouldn’t spin properly.   I had to get my son to help me to try and move it back.   Made no attempt at just wiping it, or showing it any care or attention, just did bare minimum.   Left box with old bit from machine, so I had to dispose of that.     Said to my son they wouldn’t come out  if we didn’t clean the filter, but didn’t show us how to, or even know if he did.   He didn’t check the machine as he would have noticed the door lock doesn’t work either, but that wasn’t repaired.   Thank you for the repair, but not very thorough.

                This is the noisiest appliance ever. We have a fridge/freezer, dishwasher, and two other fridges ALL of which are silent by comparison. I asked about the fan noise soon after I bought it and was told it was perfectly normal. Well, as this replaced an almost identical looking wine fridge branded Capel which was silent, I was extremely disappointed. Surely you could manufacture this with a silent or near silent fan? Others can obviously do it and I thought the Hoover brand name would be first class and the highest quality but this is just cheap and not very good at all.

                I still don’t have a washer dryer. 3 weeks after I logged the fault and no word on when the engineer is coming back to ‘check again’ for the fourth time that it can’t be fixed. Despite the fact he said last time it can’t be fixed. I can’t phone to chase up because so far it’s cost for £40 in out of plan calls to keep calling you!!!

                Utterly useless, engineer sent out and rather than fix the washing machine actually damaged it further, didn’t test it and as such broke the module and the machine wouldn’t recognise the door locking. ‘Engineer’ wouldn’t come back out as he was too busy!! In short they offered us zero help and made matters worse, I had to buy a new machine. I wouldn’t touch Hoover with a barge pole wearing rubber gloves. In short useless machines and shocking support when things go wrong

He tried several things unsuccessfully and left saying Hoover would get back to me in 2-3 days. They didnâ€™t! I tried several times to get an answer (but I guess Covid played its part. After an email or maybe with time I received an email saying it was not repairable and giving me a choice of replacements. All good ones too. Having made my choice I have been promised it within 5-6 working days, and several updates. All very smooth

                Avoid at all costs. Customer service staff not all but some are extremely rude. Waiting over a week for engineer. Engineer once here is fantastic. But the company itself and the products are dire. I have had to wait over 3 weeks for a new drum for a 5 month old washing machine. Last year had to wait over 13 weeks for repairs and washing machine was replaced with current one. No complaints department. And call centre staff extremely rude. Some more than helpfull. Will never buy a product from this company again.

                Hoover Dynamic Next A*** model DXOA 68C3/1-80 only 1 year and 4 months old, household of 2 so not heavily used. Today new motor and board. Now an hour later won't complete a spin even when loaded up. First Hoover washer I've bought, with insurance this now costing well over 500.00 for 2 years, not worth it. Disappointed as I thought I was buying a good product. Engineer can't come til next week so in effect got no washer for over 2 weeks.  Things got worse. New replacement washer through their insurance arrived but due to COVID-19, it couldn't be fitted by delivery team. I managed to do that, it's a Hoover AXI A*** 9 KGS.  The LED display can only be seen in the dark so rang them to explain I couldn't make out what program it was on at all and was this the way it was supposed to be. Agreed to send an engineer who now has ordered parts so that LED display can be seen. Don't know how or when it will be sorted out. Set the wash program in the dark, the machine seems to work fine.

                Whilst the second engineer gave me a lot more info on the machine I was shocked that the advertising on the machine which led to the purchase has proved to be so misleading. The machine was described as 9kg, 1600 spin with a 59 minute programme. However the 1600 spin and 9kg washes are for 4 white programmes only of 205 minutes minimum , and the rest are 2.5 -.4.5kgs only and a maximum 1200 spin and I have to constantly use the spin programme on top to get it dry enough. Very much not the machine I thought I was buying and the first ever to not add up to worth the money! I will be telling everyone I know what a poor machine I have purchased !

                Shocked by the total lack of flexibility with Hoover Candy Service department.  Booked a service call on 10/03/20 to be told the soonest they can get an engineer here was 18/03/20. Guess what, just been called today to say the engineer can't make it and the next available slot is 25/03/20, 15 days to fix a washing machine. When I said this was unacceptable I was told, there's nothing they will do about it.  Essentially it's the 25th or go buy a new washing machine. Seriously not happy with Hoover / Candy, next machine will be a Meile

<<<<<<< HEAD
                I’ve been very dissatisfied with my entire experience of buying a washer drier from hoover. It was purchased just over a year ago on 31st December 2018. We only had it three months when it stopped drying the clothes. When my husband called to get an engineer out we were told we should be paying for insurance in case there was any damage to the machine, otherwise we would get charged for the repair, we were advised that dog hair in the machine would be considered damage and since we have two dogs we found it impossible that there would be no dog hair in the machine and thought it best to take the insurance.  We have subsequently found out that this advise was not accurate, and when my husband had asked in a later phone call was met with an abrupt reply of “nobody forced you to take the insurance”. The machine has broken a subsequent three times since the first time, each time the same engineer attended.  At one point we were advised that the machine needed a part replaced, which was quite disappointing after only having it for a few months. The machine had broken down at the start of February for the 4th time and after having another call out from the same engineer he advised he was going to ask for a replacement machine, that we would get a telephone call within the next couple of days and a new machine within a week. By the end of the week we had heard nothing. My husband had called again to be told that the request for replacement had been escalated as the replacement team did not think a replacement was necessary and did not trust the engineers judgement(I don’t know why they don’t believe their engineers) however nobody had thought to contact us about it. They replacement team only had two of the four repairs on the system and it apparently was quite a task resolving the issue. It took several phone calls and over two weeks to finally be told that there was nothing could be done and a replacement was indeed necessary. All the while we still have a broken machine. We were told that we could go onto the hoover website to pick a new machine of the same spec, and a link was sent via email. The link had only one machine of the same spec but when we looked on the website there was another machine we liked better. We called to ask if we could have this instead (and we were willing to pay an upgrade fee) to be told it was out of stock and that we were to take the machine from the email link. We are also to pay £9.60 for the removal of the machine and £14 for installation, if we did not pay the removal fee they were just going to leave us with two machines. Apparently good customer service is not at the forefront but gouging money out of people is. I was hoping to keep my machine for years but in all honesty I think as soon as I’ve saved for a new machine I will buy one from a different company and see the back of Hoover permanently.

                Bought Hoover Tumbledryer 10 weeks ago. Phoned on Monday under guarantee. First appointment on Friday. Drum on Tumbledryer has a tear on it. Hoover will not replace machine but will supply a new drum. What they Don't tell you it's 5 days lead time for new parts. What a joke. So 10 weeks old and can't use appliance for nearly 2 weeks. Not the type of service I expect from any company. Think carefully before you buy Hoover/Candy .

                Compact and attractively made, this appliance fit well into my kitchen.   Its controls are adequate although generally rather small for my aging eyes.   I found the ""Crust Colour"" indicator particularly difficult to see.  The way several features are indicated on one screen is sometimes confusing.    .   I read through the instructions and I came to the actual recipes.  This was what it was all about!    I followed the basic bread instructions meticulously; and started the programme.   In use the Bread-Maker was very good; no undue noise or vibration. The only smell emitted was delightful.   However, the final result almost cracked my worktop when i tipped it out; my loaf was like a house-brick   I turned to the back of the Manual for error messages and, turning the pages, happened to see a comment telling me to use WARM water!!   If only this had been mentioned in the earlier part. Since then my only failure was when I used yeast whose ""best before date"" was 2013.   Seeded bread and Wholewheat bread  worked well;  my next adventure will be Gluten-free. The Display Panel is rather cramped - I have difficulty seeing the indicator for Crust.   Some revision of the Manual would be appreciated.   However,I think I have value for money.   .

Luckily for me I arrived just as he was about to leave, that is why the one less star.  Right as for the repairer he was brilliant, friendly, helpful and of course sorted out my machine, so he has all of the 4 stars and if it was just him he would have 5 stars.

                Engineer was polite and respectful.  He listened to what I had to say about the problems with the washing machine and then performed tests to check the systems.

At this stage I will continue to use the machine, hoping that the motor will bed in and become quite and stop the whirring sound when spinning.

                Extremely disappointed with their customer service. My washing machine had a fault after 6 months, a very simple fix (the part on their website is £13). I called to make an engineer appointment on 23rd February. They passed me over to third party who has mucked about wanting to order new doors etc. After 2 weeks of no one even attending my property to even look at the fault I called again and they said they would send one of their engineers out instead. No one turned up and apparently I’ve now been put back to this other company and they will come out to assess the fault on the 19th March. That’s if they even turn up. The person on the phone said they can’t help me I’ve got to call the other company. Useless!

                My washing m/c had only 10 hrs of use 4 weeks old, it was making a loud knocking noise on spin mode. I phoned hoover who sent an engineer out who inspected the m/c, he said he could find no faults but said it was much noisier than he would expect but he could do nothing about it as he could not find any fault causing the noise and i would need to phone hoover. When i phoned them they said they would take no further action as the engineers report said no fault was found. Without going into detail the shop where i bought the m/c came and inspected the m/c and agreed the noise was totally unacceptable and replaced the m/c with a different make. Hoover were no help whatsoever in fact i would say they disowned me and any responsibility for supplying a faulty m/c. I personally will never ever purchase any hoover equipment again.

                Not good at all. The washing Machine 2 faults within 6 weeks One of which potentially quite dangerous. Customer services more than useless and no response from the email I sent directly to hoover needing advice. From this experience will not have a hoover product again.

                The whole experience was nothing short of dismal. The machine was delivered with a fault. Currys, where it was purchased, were truly shocking with their complete lack of customer service and indifference. I would never shop with Currys again and would think very long before purchasing another Hoover product.

                Never again!!  Against my better judgement, I purchased a candy tumble dryer 4 months ago.  It's been broken for the past 6 weeks &amp; on the blink longg before that.   Hoover sent an engineer out twice in the same week... changed a circuit board &amp; then a door seal... &amp; it's still not working properly.  So I contacted customer service &amp; they pushed it to a resolution team... who resolved nothing.  After not hearing back for 10 days, despite a promise of a resolution decision in 5 days, I contacted them again.  I was told an engineer should have contacted me... but strangely asked what was the issue with the machine!??  My head is hurting by now.... and then because I won't clear my work diary (for the 3rd time) to accommodate an engineer at any time of day... and they can't even narrow it down to a half day... it's going to be a further 3 weeks until someone can come.  Call me awkward... but what kind of customer service is that??? It's not my fault your product  is faulty.. so why am I the only one in this that needs to flexible??    I will never again purchase from this ridiculous company... I was warned against it,  but couldn't imagine anyone being this bad.   Be warned

                My partner and I moved into our new apartment in November 2018 and we had a company fit a brand new fitted kitchen costing over €5000 which included a hoover fridge-freezer and a candy oven along with a dishwasher. The company fitted and supplied all the appliances and we hoped that would be that. Little did we know that both the oven and the fridge would not work properly and cause us considerably trouble in trying to fix.  We rang your call centre in the first week of November 2019 and the lady said it was a few days over warranty but as a measure of goodwill that hoover would cover the cost of repairing them. An engineer Ciaran,eventually came out a few weeks later to try to fix the oven. Sadly all he did was tighten a few screws and we had to see would this work. This fix didn't work and he had to call out another few weeks later to try and fix it again. This again didn't work and I had to get him out a third time where he replaced the oven motor. I had told him to look at fridge during these visits but he insisted that it would have to be done another time as he would have to email hoover to get go ahead. Eventually he came in early January and said the fridge-freezer was not worth repairing as it was ""economically unviable to do so as the condenser wasn't working right"". He said he would sign off on this and that hoover would be in contact to replace the fridge-freezer.  Well I'm sick of waiting so I rang Ciaran the engineer today and he said hoover  should have gotten back to us. He gave me the telephone number in the U.K. and a job reference number: 16759442 and I was speaking to a guy called John who said we would have to pay €150 to get a new fridge freezer. He then went on to say I would have to get the invoice from the third party company who fitted the kitchen and email it to ye and it will be reviewed.  At this stage I'm totally sick of being passed from pillar to post and getting nowhere. Clearly the oven and the fridge were not fit for purpose and under the Supply of Goods and services act 1980, they are clearly not fit for purpose.  As I write this I'm listening to the fridge make an awful noise and I'm sick of it at this stage. I can't afford to pay out more money and I'm getting increasingly frustrated.   I'll never again buy or recommend anyone to buy hoover or candy products as they clearly are sub standard. Out of the 3 appliances in our new kitchen, 2 out of three were defective. It's not a good advertisement for reliable products is it..........I would say AVOID!!!!!

Hoover,Office Supplies,2 stars: Poor,"
                Before I go on, AO have been amazing, Hoover are the ones that have been naff.   From new, it has had three washes. The first was to rinse it out before use. The second, the clothes came out warm and not smelling of detergent or conditioner meaning it at least didn't get a cold rinse and possibly never had the powder washed into the load.   The third wash on a baby cycle which was only a third full stopped half way through and returned an error code of E08. For some BIZARRE reason the code is not listed in the user manual. I tried to download the android software which only has a 1 star from the Play Store and couldn't get it. Google tells me it is a motor fault.   The machine does seem louder than we are used to but it does mention in the spec that comparatively, it is a noisier machine.    Phoned Hoover, they confirmed the error code and blamed it on being under loaded and asked me if I wanted an engineer visit which I might have to pay for depending on what the engineer says despite the error code clearly showing a machine fault. Hoover rep was not helpful, didn't know squat about washing machines, ignored what I told her and talked to me like I was stupid e.g. was it plumbed in correctly! Is there anyone who could not screw a water hose on and plug it in?   Rang AO, the guy was excellent, knew loads about washing machines, he considered the whole situation by listening to my facts and incorporating the age of the machine, how we had used it etc and concluded it was more likely a serious fault over user error. As it had been reported straight away he decided to swap the machine for another at the first opportunity. No cost, no risk, just minor inconvenience at having to plumb in another machine and get rid of the packaging.   HOOVER, DONT TALK TO ME LIKE I AM A CHILD.

                6th engineer visit in first 10 months of owning tumble dryer, plug melted and still no response from escalations!!! I am absolutely appalled at the Customer Service received from Hoover Candy.  The majority of first line staff have agreed with me but all they can do is pass the details on to escalations and I never hear back.  Had Tumble Dryer 10 months, on my 6th call out from local company as due to staff sickness there are no engineers in my area.  Still without a working tumble dryer.  On last visit even had to replace the power lead as plug had melted and cracked my electrical socket!! Replaced second thermostat within 3 weeks and still not staying on so have no idea what to do next.  Feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.  Never had such poor service ever.

Hoover,Office Supplies,2 stars: Poor,"
                Before I go on, AO have been amazing, Hoover are the ones that have been naff.   From new, it has had three washes. The first was to rinse it out before use. The second, the clothes came out warm and not smelling of detergent or conditioner meaning it at least didn't get a cold rinse and possibly never had the powder washed into the load.   The third wash on a baby cycle which was only a third full stopped half way through and returned an error code of E08. For some BIZARRE reason the code is not listed in the user manual. I tried to download the android software which only has a 1 star from the Play Store and couldn't get it. Google tells me it is a motor fault.   The machine does seem louder than we are used to but it does mention in the spec that comparatively, it is a noisier machine.    Phoned Hoover, they confirmed the error code and blamed it on being under loaded and asked me if I wanted an engineer visit which I might have to pay for depending on what the engineer says despite the error code clearly showing a machine fault. Hoover rep was not helpful, didn't know squat about washing machines, ignored what I told her and talked to me like I was stupid e.g. was it plumbed in correctly! Is there anyone who could not screw a water hose on and plug it in?   Rang AO, the guy was excellent, knew loads about washing machines, he considered the whole situation by listening to my facts and incorporating the age of the machine, how we had used it etc and concluded it was more likely a serious fault over user error. As it had been reported straight away he decided to swap the machine for another at the first opportunity. No cost, no risk, just minor inconvenience at having to plumb in another machine and get rid of the packaging.   HOOVER, DONT TALK TO ME LIKE I AM A CHILD.

                6th engineer visit in first 10 months of owning tumble dryer, plug melted and still no response from escalations!!! I am absolutely appalled at the Customer Service received from Hoover Candy.  The majority of first line staff have agreed with me but all they can do is pass the details on to escalations and I never hear back.  Had Tumble Dryer 10 months, on my 6th call out from local company as due to staff sickness there are no engineers in my area.  Still without a working tumble dryer.  On last visit even had to replace the power lead as plug had melted and cracked my electrical socket!! Replaced second thermostat within 3 weeks and still not staying on so have no idea what to do next.  Feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.  Never had such poor service ever.

                The Washing Engineer was fantastic however booking an appointment wasn’t as straightforward. I asked to speak to a manager after one of you operators put the phone down on me as I wasn’t happy about the service I had received. I was neither rude nor aggressive but was constantly spoken over . I received a call but spoke to a more professional operator who had an excellent manner.

                On purchasing a Hoover Double Oven in October 2019, was initially happy with the product.. However,  we have now been without a working oven for 26 days  - we have had 2 visits from the engineer, none of which solved the problem, we were informed they have 28 days to solve this - but here we are 26 days in with no response &amp; no oven &amp; absolutely no feedback or communication, to say we are appalled is an understatement. All of the communication we have had has been us chasing them for a response, even to the point , that we were told to pick another oven, went to collect it &amp; the person knew nothing about what we were asking.. You could not make this up.. I will never buy another of their products.. &amp; please do us all a favour &amp; take a refresher  course in customer services.. The money it has cost to hire a van to pick up the new oven (which then did not exist!) We are living on sandwiches &amp; tinned products, but all Hoover had to say was ""we have 28 days""... not the fact that they could have helped straight away (very defensive) ... A letter has been sent to your Chief Exec. The only positive out of this was the engineer who came to the house, who did everything possible to help us &amp; even then Hoover disbelieved him!!!!

                Bought £180 worth of cordless vacuum on Christmas eve 2019, very pleased with the vacuum cleaner.  Went to charge the battery last week and dropped the plug onto a soft carpeted floor, the black/negative pin snapped off, rendering the charger useless.  Over the years I've owned many appliances with similar plugs, all robust enough to outlive the appliance, they're obviously using cheap materials to save money now, so beware.  I emailed Hoover to see if they would/could help, they didn't want to know/weren't interested.  I now have a useless vacuum!!!!!!  Luckily I kept my old Henry, 15 years old and still going strong, more than I can say for Hoover, two months old and useless!!!!!  THEY EVEN EMPLOY PEOPLE TO REPLY TO REVIEWS AND WASTE MORE OF MY TIME BY ANSWERING IN THE FALSE HOPE OF A POSITIVE SOLUTION, ONLY TO GET A DON'T WANT TO KNOW/DON'T CARE ATTITUDE FROM THEM -- AGAIN.   I REITERATE, HOOVER PRODUCTS ARE A LOAD OF RUBBISH, DO NOT TOUCH WITH A BARGE POLE!!  FURTHER CAVEAT, NO LUCK/HELP FROM HOOVER, QUOTED £17.50 FOR NEW PLUG, HA, £11.50 FROM E-BAY, SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT RUBBISH COMPANY, COMPLETE RIP-OFF !!!!!!!!!

                DHL 1482D3/1-80 8kg 1400.  Avoid avoid avoid. Also avoid because of customer services unless you want to be royally ripped of.  Machine flooded kitchen after six weeks. After twelve weeks it burnt towels and smelled my house out. It carried on doing both three times over the next nine months.  Engineer came last time and said he had fixed the leak. Within just half an hour it was leaking from the exact same spot so I sent a picture to hoover who said there was no fault when the engineer came. Pardon me !!  Their area manager told me their machines can’t take more than three towels in a single wash and that’s why I had dirty marks as I overloaded. Not dirty marks, burns the smells was awful in my whole house.  Three towels in an 8kg machine !,  Insulting to their own machine that excuse is !,  It’s so noisy it’s like a pneumatic drill, if it’s not tucked away under counters it actually travels across your floor bashing into things. I know as it’s been out in the middle of my kitchen recently, cos of a leak, and it ended up moving and hitting hell into my radiator on spin, it’s vicious. I’ve never had an error code for any fault I’ve had so obviously their mother board isn’t showing any to them, Probably yet another fault of the stupid machine. I’m left with an unusable leaking machine that you can’t wash more than a quarter of a load and you can’t use more than a 40 degree wash or it may burn your clothes and is leaking all over my floor so I have to disconnect the water supply after each use.   The detergent draw won’t open the same time as the door is open and it holds water so is permanently smelly and filthy.  I paid my own plumber to look at the leak and he was disgusted it was left like that and located the issue within two mins. Disgraceful machine. Disgraceful customer service.  They want your cash but then do not care for your safety.  Buy at your own risk. As not 14 months later I don’t have a properly working machine and hoover care not one jot.  Last engineer call out he fixed the leak (he said).  As he didn’t I sent a picture and I was told there wasn’t a fault and I’m entitled to nothing else.   Pardon me !!!!!   It wasnt fixed !!!!  Six call outs in less than a year, burns, floods, (plural) and all I get is a plethora of excuses, mainly that the computer says there’s no fault.  Well my eyes tell me otherwise as does my nose as does my floor and my mop.  A joke of a not fit for purpose machine and a joke of a not fit for purpose company.

Last engineer call out he fixed the leak (he said).  As he didnâ€™t I sent a picture and I was told there wasnâ€™t a fault and Iâ€™m entitled to nothing else.   Pardon me !!!!!   It wasnt fixed !!!!  Six call outs in less than a year, burns, floods, (plural) and all I get is a plethora of excuses, mainly that the computer says thereâ€™s no fault.  Well my eyes tell me otherwise as does my nose as does my floor and my mop.  A joke of a not fit for purpose machine and a joke of a not fit for purpose company.

                I had an issue with my washing machine not that long after installation.  I spoke with their support team who from the very start provided me with exceptional service.   After a long discussion, and a few laughs, I did end up taking out the monthly insurance (which i never normally do) I'm just thankful for the peace of mind should anything happen in the future. When the engineer came out to repair my washing machine, he very kindly helped remove my plinths to pull the machine out. Within 10 minutes he had diagnosed and replaced a faulty motor, plus, again, helping me put the plinths back in place. From start to finish, I cannot fault this service. Thank you so much.

                If you're unemployed and like sitting at home all day then this is the company for you. My washing machine is 2 years old, the programme selector started to fail.  I took a day off work , because they cannot give you any guidance on when they will arrive until that morning........who thinks that's acceptable?  Engineer 'fixed' the issue, 3 months later the same problem, another day off work but this time the engineer was ill.  When I called to rescehedule I was expected to take another day off.  I told them I had no more annual leave left but they refused to assure me a first call of the day.  So next date booked, whether the engineer arrives for the 8.30 slot I have no idea. Oh, and they don't work Saturdays unless overtime is required.  Polite staff but couldn't have been less helpful if they'd tried. NEVER buy a Hoover Candy product, buyer beware.

                Purchased a washer dryer in September 2019, on 2nd February it made a loud bang and fused my kitchen.  I have been told they won't replace it without trying to repair it even though the parts outweigh the replacement cost.  I am now on day 29 with 3 young children and no washer dryer because it is still waiting for parts which have no eta and they are still refusing to offer me a replacement.  Absolutely disgusting customer service

I can't get a real person for support and they want to charge 19.99 to speak with someone. I am sadly disappointed in HP. I thought they were a reliable company but all I see is a lack of care, greed, and the runaround.  Now they have my $15 paid on May 2nd, the cartridge is no good,  I can't get a tech support, and a virtual agent is not helping but shoots out responses that were made with people may encounter.

                In March, I ordered an HP Envy Desktop with several custom features, cost around $1,500.  Initially I was told 3-6 business days, then it became about 21 days, then 28 business days.  After numerous call to HP Support, I just learned that they are waiting for an unknown part to arrive from somewhere, that won't be received until sometime in June.  Maybe!!  What a company and what a poor effort at communications.  One would think that I would be contacted to see if I wanted to continue to wait for this part or perhaps change one of my features so the computer could be finished and shipped, but NO. Asked the support person, ""well, can you contact the factory and determine what the missing part is"" NO. ""can you contact the factory and determine if they truly expect the part in June"" NO. ""but if I knew which part was the issue, maybe I could change my specs""  NO.  Overall, a huge disappointment and I certainly could not recommend them.  Probably going to cancel order and get refund and hope for the best with someone that actually cares about customer service.

                The laptops always seem to have issues. On the other hand I have terrible luck with laptops. I've had 2 arrive faulty (from other companies).  Getting in touch can be quite difficult sometimes. I purchased my laptop at currys and they kept saying on the website that if I bought from currys or dixons that my warranty is with teamknowhow, and that the factory one does not apply which..isn't true? I've never had any evidence of this at all and my laptop came with a factory warranty. Because it's registered as purchased at Currys I kept hitting a wall trying to get help with my severely broken laptop. It wouldn't let me get through to customer service because they knew it was bought at Currys!   A huge piece of metal somehow just came out of the laptop, it was sticking out at all times, very heavy. I don't know where it came from and there was no way of pushing it..back inside or ...anything like that. It was immovable. Utterly bizarre issue I've never encountered haha. On top of that eventually the screen started to crack and crumble! It wasn't dropped, it was spontaneous and I have no clue how that piece of metal physically was sticking out the laptop, there's no giant hole for it.  It was within factory warranty and I contacted HP via facebook if I recall but I was extremely doubtful they'd help me. I thought they would just say I broke it and frankly, I don't know how I would have been physically capable of getting that piece of metal but I know a lot of CS places will do anything to not help you.  That being said, I sent a few pictures, explained the above and HP happily collected my laptop. I was very worried that they would hold my laptop and tell me I need to pay a fortune to get it fixed but they actually fixed it free of charge! It was only gone for 5 days in total!  This is not the first time I have had problems with an HP laptop. My first one the solid state drive was screwed up or something. Was a few years ago so I'm foggy on the specifics. The laptop went incredibly slow and you practically couldn't use it. I had nothing but your standard protective software on it so it was not overloaded with installs. Really only used it for internet. Cleared the cache, removed unnecessary preinstalls. Still, the memory was at almost full use! I had to fight them a little on getting a repair for it but they did free of charge despite being JUST out of warranty. Collected, repaired and returned within about 2 weeks.  Overall, the products are..not the best for me..but I do have bad luck with laptops, can't lie. Out of all laptops I've had HP have been the best customer service wise.  Trying to get through to CS was a bloody nightmare for me with my current laptop being from Currys but when I did get hold of them eventually, they sorted out my issue fantastically and within a very good time frame.   Also have an HP printer that had a couple of issues and HP support took me through sorting the issues out step by step.

I've only had HP's for the past 20 years, but I just can't use their junk any more. My last computer was so horrible that I sent it in to be fixed multiple times and they couldn't fix it. It would keep turning itself off. The last time they had it for a month and it was still not being fix so they finally decided to give me store credit even though I only had possession of the computer for a few months, the rest of the time they had it and were working on fixing it. To get them to even accept taking it back to ""fix"" it was days of arguing with them after I had done some factory resets. Then instead of giving me a new computer they only gave me a refund that I had to use in their store. Now the computer I have is also a piece of crap, but I have given up on HP completely so I haven't tried to get it fixed after all the fighting I had to do with the last one. This is my third computer in a row that has been horrible. I am NEVER buying another HP product again. When this computer is dead and I have to shell out more money it will be going somewhere else.

                Absolute trash When you call in, they only allow you to text their bot helper, who is supposed to help or allow you to talk to a person if they can't resolve your issue. They couldn't but my printer is out of warranty so I can't get help. My printer has been printing shadows behind text (a very common issue as I've seen/read many threads asking how to fix it), their suggestion is turn it off and back on again, have you tried cleaning the cartridges? etc and after doing all of that nothing has changed. Seems they simply have faulty products and don't have any options to help or fix it. Waste of time and absolutely frustrating. I'm a freakin 20 something who never leaves reviews/gets this upset, but they've failed entirely at providing any assistance and need to work on customer service/product fixing/having better, actually functional products in general or they really deserve to go under

                I am really p*ssed off my warranty that I bought runs out on Monday, I tried calling today because my printer is not working anymore and the dumb b*tch that I talked to told me To call back on Monday and hung up on me I tried several more times today to get someone to validate my warranty and not a damn person would help me they keep hanging up on me! Once I get my replacement I will never buy another Hewitt packer product again customer service sucks

                I bought an 8010 printer and it came with cartridges. I’ve signed up to the ‘free’ introductory Instant Ink offer and after printing 100 pages, including 20 or do that were just part of printer set up, I’ve received a message that I’m going to be charged per page from now on - using a cartridge that I paid for as it came with my printer! That’s ridiculous  With my old Officejet 6500 I typically replaced the XL cartridges every 2 years and they typically cost £50. In the same period, after the offer ends, Instant Ink will cost a minimum £94.80 PLUS 6.6p per page over 100 per month. My initial impression is now that Instant Ink is a rip-off.

                Spent $1300CAD on a HP touchscreen laptop for it to need to be repaired within the 1st year. 3 years in and it's completely not working, as by the online troubleshooting walk throughs I can see this happens often.  Their customer service is appalling. If we spoke to our customers the way they did after paying thousands of dollars we wouldn't have a job. ""Sorry you don't have warranty anymore we can't help you.""...all I needed assistance with was walking me through a factory reset for this piece of garbage product. Not only will I NEVER purchase an HP item again, I will make sure no family or friends do either.

                Nothing but bad experiences with this company, let me go into detail and tell you why:  They sent me the wrong laptop -- twice in a row. First with the wrong monitor, second with the wrong graphics card. Had I not been tech savvy I doubt anyone else would've noticed. It cost me about $50 to have it sent back, despite the fact they sent me the wrong laptop.  You can't cancel orders and you will always have to pay a restocking fee, even if it was their mistake.  They're out to scam you and their support line is the worst of the worst. Avoid this company as much as you can.

                The support is abysmal. I bought an ENVY5000 home printer, the setup was fine but the next day it was not being seen by my Mac at the point of printing even though the printer and computer were online and HP's app was telling me it could see the printer.  I tried to troubleshoot it with a bot and was predictably sent around in circles doing things that were clearly not going to work and which got increasingly technical. You should not need to mess around with servers etc. for two hours or need an IS degree to get a home printer to work.  If I could only find out how to uninstall everything and set it up again from scratch I could have sorted the issue in under half an hour - to get that info. though I would need to be able to speak to a human as the website, app etc. are all as inflexible as the bot support.  The product seems like it is good value if it's working but I'm afraid the support and troubleshootng options are too bad and inflexible. I will never be purchasing any HP hardware again as it is overcomplicated while also offering poor support.  I'm sure there are slightly more expensive options that save a lot of hassle and stress in the long run. I will definitely be purchasing my next printer from a different company.

                Hewlett Packard is by far the worst computer manufacturing company till date in my experience. The company speaks very highly of their products but in reality its the juxtapose. The vendor claimed that the system has a great processor with an updated software when I bought an HP product, but it came to me as a surprise that there is nothing extraordinary about the product. My PC is getting slower day by day. The company really needs to focus on the reason of its existence, being a Human Resource Associate in my company I believe the quality of the product or services delivered by a company defines the quality of people and management of the company.

                I bought an HP Spectre about 2 years ago. A few months ago the sound from the unit came and went. Ear buds continued working. Eventually the sound quit working altogether... and the ear bud sound quit as well. HP tech tested the laptop with me with the result stating the sound worked. In the real world, it did not. HP next advised me to wipe the drive and reinstall everything. I did so and... no sound. Now, the desktop changes format on its own. Wifi disconnects. I checked around and these issues appear common with HP products. My advice... look into HP products and service before buying any product they make.

Just because an item is out of warranty doesn't mean you should stop providing support. It is forcing consumers to buy new units when they don't need to and it is promoting waste culture. Absolutely zero corporate social responsibility and company ethics at its worst. It is madness and incredibly irresponsible on their part that I have paid for a product and they want me to buy a new unit rather than fix the one I have.

                I bought the HP 360 Envy, the laptop can do the basics of what I need but I am going to rip HP apart as a company. It is nothing more than a greedy corporation that doesn't care about its customers. I had this piece of krap for a month and the strap to my laptop carrier broke, and the corner of the laptop where the start button is was bent up and unusable. I purchased a 2-year warranty when I bought the laptop, HP does not honor warranties unless you buy directly from them but since I purchased through BestBuy they wouldn't cover the damage which was 400 for a little bent corner. Hope they go out of business, I will keep steering people clear of the garbage company.

                I was sent damaged Monitor and email a few days after to the relevant email with photo's. I was told I could get a replacement but there was no time frame as to when they would have them in stock, so I wanted a refund. After various emails and been bounced to different departs, I'm now being told I cant get a refund as it been over 14 days! Now I can only get a replacement and who knows how long that will be. All because they sent me a damaged unit.  Would not recommend, hopefully you get lucky and nothing is wrong with your what you purchase so you don't have to deal with their customer service.

                I placed an online order for my fiances birthday and paid for expedited shipping on Dec. 2. Once I got the confirmation email on Dec. 3 saying the PC was being built, I called immediately to cancel the order because the estimated arrival date was Dec. 17 and I would not get it in time to gift. The customer service rep stated she would submit a request for the cancelation and I would receive an email in 1-3 days. I never got an email about the cancelation; instead i got one on Dec. 9 saying that I picked a great PC. I called again and spoke to a supervisor and she told me she would fast track the request. Then 4 days later (Dec. 13), I got an email saying that my item has shipped. I then called again and spoke to a different supervisor and he told me that he will have the item returned to the sender since I did not want the item and he would refund the order. Come Dec. 17, I received the laptop with no email stating any information from any of the customer service calls (again). I did not realize the PC had to be built and canceled the order 14 days before getting it- even with expedited shipping. I spend an average of 30 min. on the phone during numerous lunch breaks just for nothing to get resolved. After debating going through the trouble of sending the laptop back and having to pay a 15% restocking fee + no refund for expedited shipping, the laptop sat in a box for a couple months and at this point we just decided to keep it. We just started using it and the built in camera has stopped working multiple times. I look up information/videos to fix it and I run into issues in Device Manager, Control Panel and it will start working, just to stop working again within less than a day. The issue is fixed a different way every time and it's hard to even say how since the settings are never the same as I left them. Not only has the laptop not been able to find the camera numerous times, but now the touch screen has not been working and we have been using it for less than a month. This has been my first experience with Hp and will most definitely be my last. I highly DO NOT recommend their products and they have the most horrible customer service I have ever dealt with.

                I guess I should have read the REAL reviews before I wasted my time to order a computer from HP.  I purchased the HP Pavilion 24-xa1008na All-in-One. I understand now why you can't leave a review on their website about their products... they appear to pick reviews manually.  I could probably had a less of a lemon if I ordered random parts from the black markets of Wuhan and assembled them blindfolded.   The desktop came with an AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile (= tech specs didn't specify that it was the mobile version) Gfx, 8Gb and 1Tb drive. Or so I thought.   It was extremely slow even with nothing but factory installations. A simple download of no more than 50MB took anywhere from 30min to 1 hr. Internet would hangs all the time although I've got very fast internet speed and my other computer has no issues at all.  The HP model had 24 outdated drivers and couldn't handle to download and install any of them (I tried for 6 hours). The 1TB drive was allocated not to the C-drive where it's needed the most but to the D-drive while the main C-drive had only 235Gb....  The so called ""Bang Olufsen"" speakers were a joke and powered 50% below average sound quality, and the sound was very poor. I sincerely doubt these speakers can be authentic Bang Olufsen ones.  For almost £800 HP doesn't even offer a recovery partition drive, which every computer I have owned in the past 15 years have. This is a severely outdated brand.   I thought HP was supposed to be one of the best brands out there... it's not even close to being average.

All this situation is driving me crazy as my uni jobs should be done and it is my only laptop.  AVOID HP SERVICES.

                I bought the HP 360 Envy, the laptop can do the basics of what I need but I am going to rip HP apart as a company. It is nothing more than a greedy corporation that doesn't care about its customers. I had this piece of krap for a month and the strap to my laptop carrier broke, and the corner of the laptop where the start button is was bent up and unusable. I purchased a 2-year warranty when I bought the laptop, HP does not honor warranties unless you buy directly from them but since I purchased through BestBuy they wouldn't cover the damage which was 400 for a little bent corner. Hope they go out of business, I will keep steering people clear of the garbage company.

                I was sent damaged Monitor and email a few days after to the relevant email with photo's. I was told I could get a replacement but there was no time frame as to when they would have them in stock, so I wanted a refund. After various emails and been bounced to different departs, I'm now being told I cant get a refund as it been over 14 days! Now I can only get a replacement and who knows how long that will be. All because they sent me a damaged unit.  Would not recommend, hopefully you get lucky and nothing is wrong with your what you purchase so you don't have to deal with their customer service.

                I placed an online order for my fiances birthday and paid for expedited shipping on Dec. 2. Once I got the confirmation email on Dec. 3 saying the PC was being built, I called immediately to cancel the order because the estimated arrival date was Dec. 17 and I would not get it in time to gift. The customer service rep stated she would submit a request for the cancelation and I would receive an email in 1-3 days. I never got an email about the cancelation; instead i got one on Dec. 9 saying that I picked a great PC. I called again and spoke to a supervisor and she told me she would fast track the request. Then 4 days later (Dec. 13), I got an email saying that my item has shipped. I then called again and spoke to a different supervisor and he told me that he will have the item returned to the sender since I did not want the item and he would refund the order. Come Dec. 17, I received the laptop with no email stating any information from any of the customer service calls (again). I did not realize the PC had to be built and canceled the order 14 days before getting it- even with expedited shipping. I spend an average of 30 min. on the phone during numerous lunch breaks just for nothing to get resolved. After debating going through the trouble of sending the laptop back and having to pay a 15% restocking fee + no refund for expedited shipping, the laptop sat in a box for a couple months and at this point we just decided to keep it. We just started using it and the built in camera has stopped working multiple times. I look up information/videos to fix it and I run into issues in Device Manager, Control Panel and it will start working, just to stop working again within less than a day. The issue is fixed a different way every time and it's hard to even say how since the settings are never the same as I left them. Not only has the laptop not been able to find the camera numerous times, but now the touch screen has not been working and we have been using it for less than a month. This has been my first experience with Hp and will most definitely be my last. I highly DO NOT recommend their products and they have the most horrible customer service I have ever dealt with.

                I guess I should have read the REAL reviews before I wasted my time to order a computer from HP.  I purchased the HP Pavilion 24-xa1008na All-in-One. I understand now why you can't leave a review on their website about their products... they appear to pick reviews manually.  I could probably had a less of a lemon if I ordered random parts from the black markets of Wuhan and assembled them blindfolded.   The desktop came with an AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile (= tech specs didn't specify that it was the mobile version) Gfx, 8Gb and 1Tb drive. Or so I thought.   It was extremely slow even with nothing but factory installations. A simple download of no more than 50MB took anywhere from 30min to 1 hr. Internet would hangs all the time although I've got very fast internet speed and my other computer has no issues at all.  The HP model had 24 outdated drivers and couldn't handle to download and install any of them (I tried for 6 hours). The 1TB drive was allocated not to the C-drive where it's needed the most but to the D-drive while the main C-drive had only 235Gb....  The so called ""Bang Olufsen"" speakers were a joke and powered 50% below average sound quality, and the sound was very poor. I sincerely doubt these speakers can be authentic Bang Olufsen ones.  For almost £800 HP doesn't even offer a recovery partition drive, which every computer I have owned in the past 15 years have. This is a severely outdated brand.   I thought HP was supposed to be one of the best brands out there... it's not even close to being average.

                Bought an HP laptop, brand new. I was so happy bc it is so fast and reliable. Then it broke down after a month. I was disappointed and came to see HP reviews. Realised there are loads of bad reviews about customer service. I panicked a bit but called HP, I told my problem and they sent a driver to pick the laptop up. 5 days later, they delivered the lap, fixed and cleaned. I think they handled the issue the best they could and I didn’t have to wait long on the phone either. I guess people tend to give bad reviews if they have issues but don’t bother to give feedback if everything is positive so after seeing this loads of bad reviews, I thought it’s the right thing to do that I give my positive feedback about my experience. Mistakes happen, it’s about how you handle them. Nice work HP

                If I could rate them zero, I would. From their tech support to their customer service, they are an absolute disaster. I had a small issue with my laptop. Called tech support for a minor issue. Let them take control of my computer. Tech person fixed the issue (just had to fix a setting) then proceeded to do a bunch of unrelated updates (BIOS and such) this wreaked havoc on my system and I had to reset my machine to factory. Because of these issues, I lost 2 days of work. Also, purchased a care pack (bad decision) and was told I could get a refund if I decided I didn't want it. I've called four times over 2 months and have yet to recieve a refund.

                This company is a criminal mastermind, I am sure of it.... Somehow, they manage to be accepted as a legitimate company, selling legitimate products, but they are a SCAM.  They sell products that are almost instantly 'Out of Warranty', and will not provide any form of direct support for them after the 30 minutes of warranty runs out, unless you keep paying them to renew the warranty. This is much like Microsoft, and many other tech companies that do not support their own products unless you constantly make recurring payments to them for support. I made the dire mistake of buying an HP Envy 4520 all in one printer, for my home office setup, and the warranty ran out before i got it home.  *It was supposed to be a Wireless printer, but I ended up having to get a USB cord to plug it in directly for it to work. *It is constantly running low on ink, even if you only printed a couple of pages. *The head alignment is consistently off, and cannot be reset properly using the provided HP Utility app. *The only support they will provide for their equipment is through the community forums, which is a long process of waiting for an answer, if you 'warranty' has expired, which as I said above happens before you can even get the device home from the store. *If you do manage to have 5 minutes left on your 'warranty', and can get direct support, it is from some overseas call center, who can barely speak English, and does not truly know anything about the products. *If you are in my situation, and have a presentation that is later this morning, but cannot print out the necessary documents because of a piece of garbage printer, you must post a question in the forums, and wait for a couple of days to get a response, which will inevitably just be asking for more information.  I need help NOW Hewlett Packard, not eventually.... BEWARE of this joke company, they sell junk products, in shiny boxes, and provide NOTHING that even qualifies as Support for their sweatshop garbage!!

                I will never buy any ink off from you. The whole process is pathetic, wasted so much of my time. And clearly you know that I have bought a brand new printer and 5 inks and yet you and your stupid policy makes it so inflexible. I had to send in invoices through emails and WhatsApp repeatedly and got informed the invoice in my emails are not official emails. Why did you send out invoice with subject INVOICE to my emails if they are not official emails!!!  If you guys think this is a ""promotion"", it sounds more like a rip off to customers.  Cutting off QR codes off the boxes, sending ""official"" invoices, WhatsApping your unhelpful customer representative, my time is worth more than $900 coupon. You guys did nothing to help other than saying sorry. And now I get a rejection of this thing clearly proves my point right. This promotion procedure is as hopeless as your company policy. Don't bother throw out a promotion if you are not genuinely trying to help your customer.

After finally connecting with someone, it took another 15 minutes for them to tell me that I had to PAY for a premium service in order for them to answer it. This is simply unacceptable.

Talk to the vitual ASSisatant that can't understand the issue.  Is everyone at HP sick or dead from coronavirus or are you actually closed or just understaffed as most incompetent off shore support groups these days?

                I have had HP products for many years and generally would rate them as adequate. However their customer service is the worst I've ever encountered in any industry. I tried to contact them through their weekly (?) promotional emails for over 6 months with no results. I tried to send them direct emails - no results. Over a week ago I called the number in the email and after over an hour on the phone and being transferred 4 times (once back to someone I had already talked to) I was assured that my problem would be/was taken care of. It has not! I am now currently on hold for over an hour. I appreciate that currently there may a high volume of calls but shouldn't a company that wants to respond to customer's enquiries, give you an estimate of how long you'll be on hold and/or allow you to leave a message or allow you to leave your number to be called back. Summary - ONLY BUY HP IF YOU EXPECT TO NEVER HAVE TO CONTACT THEM!

                I would rate 0, but have to rate at least 1... Ordered an Envy Laptop (with monitor and backpack), was promised a 3 Business Day Delivery. Received the Backpack and Monitor in 3 business days. The Backpack came in a huge box with 5 times the bag's volume worth of filler. During the next 2 weeks, I was led to believe I had to wait for the PC. Then one day I was told I had to call Canada Post. I called Canada Post and they swore that the packages were all delivered. Now HP was telling me I had to file a lost package report with Canada Post. So ensued finger-pointing of Canada Post, the receptionist who signed for the packages and HP sitting in the distance indifferent and unhelpful. Finally, I called HP back to complain about the whole process which I found ridiculous. Dealing with customer service is painful. Asked to speak with a Supervisor. The Supervisor tells me that the PC is actually on backorder, so they offer me a different PC, but then it takes 3 days to confirm a price. Ultimately, I canceled the order and now it will take a month to get a refund. Went to the local Memory Express and picked up a great PC same-day, better price, better quality. I've had many bad experiences with HP Printers in the past, but this takes the cake. Totally useless company...

                I recently purchased an HP I5- db010. I left it in the box for several weeks before I had a chance to open it. After a few uses it is very slow; is the start up and the operations. I have nothing on it other than I used it for about 6 emails. Unfortunately, because I did not use it for several weeks after purchase I was unable to return it for refund. It's my own fault however that does not take away from the fact that it is terribly slow. Fortunately, I do not need it for work. Two weeks prior I had purchased an ASUS for my wife and the ASUS has this HP beaten in every way possible. ( 2 weeks later) I have now used it to open EXCEL.

                Wow. So screw HP. I'm trying to set up this printer that I have had for years and I'm having issues with it so I decide I'm going to call tech support. I can't find the support phone number anywhere on their website because they want me to use the virtual assistant. The virtual assistant didn't have the answer that I needed for my question. I searched up and down their website looking for a phone number and could not find one. so I went to a different website that specializes in contact phone numbers for support, when those companies don't want you to call support. I finally get the phone number and call and go through the thousands of options I have to choose through (voice activated by the way which is always annoying, it's so much easier to just hit 1 or 2, etc) and after about 10 minutes of that, I find out that they charge you $20 just to talk to a tech support person if your product is out of warranty. I bought this printer back in like 2016. Like legitimately I'm just trying to find the PIN number for my printer. What the hell?! I would give them zero stars if I could.

                ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!!! I purchased a hp 5230 all in one printer in March of 2019. No end of trouble....instant ink is a right old rip off, so I bought my own cartridges from Currys. WELL, surprise sur chuffing prise.... The two 302 XL cartridges that I've paid Â£30+ each for, are, according to the useless contraption, outdated for my machine!!!! This is despite the fact that the sticker inside the printer carrier reads '302'. SO, I'm now left with a printer that I cannot use. What a total waste of money. I would not touch a hp anything with a barge pole.

                HP has very poor customer support. I had a problem with my printer where it could not scan despite attempts to resetting connection. I contacted HP support for help and after a week, a female employee contacted me to follow up on my enquiry. I told her the problem has been solved through the forum where someone suggested to download the scanner software. I am appalled that HP took too long to offer help but still unable to suggest any possible remedy. I would not recommend HP products to anyone nor purchasing anymore equipment from this manufacturer.

                Disgraceful. My laptop that is less than 2 months old was sent for repair due to an over heating issue on the 6th Feb via Currys PC world Limerick. I spent 2 hours in store and requested a replacement laptop but was advised that you would not give one as it was over 1 month old. The issues with my laptop started almost immediately after purchase (which you should have a log of) however as the laptop was unfamiliar to me I was unaware that there was anything wrong which is why I didn't return it sooner. I was also advised that my laptop was now discontinued and that my only option was a repair. I reluctantly agreed. I was advised I would have it back in about 6 days. I've just been told it wasn't collected until the 15th so it won't be delivered to your repair team until the 22nd. After that they can't tell me how long it will be before I get it.  It is disgraceful that you can sell a laptop that malfunctions almost immediately and not replace it with a laptop of the same spec.

                HP does not stand behind their products. I had a 2 year warranty with HP and my laptop broke 2 months before that expired.  They kept me on the phone with customer service and kept asking me to do tasks that took overnight to complete until the warranty was about to expire. They then said I would have to extend the warranty to continue to have the product repaired. Then, when I paid over $200 to extend it, they sait it was now a pre-existing problem and they wouldn't help me. Not only was I cheated out of my warranty, but they stole from me in the process.  NEVER buy anything from HP.

The laptop was returned to us even more damaged than when we sent it to them.   We bought the laptop from John Lewis with a 2 year warranty.  Both John Lewis and HP did nothing to help with the situation.  I used to think that John Lewis warranties were iron clad but this is not the case .  Buyer beware.

                I purchased an All-One PC for my son and I to use.  I contacted HP prior to purchase to confirm the computer could accommodate what we each were looking to do.  They advised that yes it could.  I ordered the computer 12/19, received it 12/31/2020 and set it up.  Downloaded a game my son wanted to play and within 10 minutes of playing it the screen began to flicker between the game and a black screen.  Then the screen went black entirely.  Tried a different game, same thing happened.  I specifically asked if the graphics on this computer could handle these games and was told yes.  Now they are saying it can't.  So I guess they tell you what you want to hear to get you to buy their computers.  This is the last HP computer I will purchase.  I have a warranty and the extended care package and when I contacted customer service, they told me I have to PAY for assistance.  The customer service rep was rude, just trying to rush me away and didn't want to be bothered to try to assist me.  Just kept telling me I had to pay for help!!! What is the point of a warranty and care package, if they won't assist?! And as a side note, I reviewed their product on their website but it was removed, they only show the positive reviews so beware.

                Absolutely terrible product and customer service.   I got a HP ENVY photo 6234 printer last year which came with HP instant ink subscription service. I assumed that the instant ink service would be a convenience. Instead it has been a NIGHTMARE, your printer must always be connect to network and the server. If HP servers are down, then you can't print anything even if u have wifi and electricity (I experienced this during the peak of my work projects). When the ink was low, I did not receive any ink for my subscription, desperate to print my documents, I bought my own ink from Currys PC .... and HP Instant ink now charges me for ink I bought myself.   When you try to get help from customer service, there is no clear number or email to contact. So I had to use their facebook profile to get a response. Again, disappointing. Unclear solutions and waste of time. 3 days back and forth on messenger, they repeat the same questions I have answered and in the end of the day have not solved anything.   Save yourself the time and stress , avoid their products !

                Have had my HP 3750 Deskjet for almost a year so it's still under warranty. I haven't used it that much. But recently have needed to print a number of documents and have had print errors or not printing at all. The Virtual Agent is a complete waste of time and when you do need to speak to someone you are directed to WhatsApp or Messenger. Why can we not talk to a human being. This is customer service at it's worst. A true measure of a good company is how they deal with problems, and HP's aftercare is not even worth the one star.

I called in and was told that it was no problem, that I could just return to sender and get a refund. Great! Ordered the laptop I meant to get.  I then noticed the address didn't have my house number (not sure if my fault or not but eh). Called them up again, the lady that responded was really helpful, told the delivery company to just return to sender instead of trying to deliver and giving them my address so the other laptop could get here.   So far all working smoothly, expecting a refund for the mistake purchase once it gets back to HP.

                I purchased a one year extension HP Warranty in December and it did not get automatically updated on the system, despite what the invoice contract stated.   After a few weeks of great frustration, an update was confirmed through using HP connected via Whatsapp which seemed to be much more successful than email enquiries - a real person at the other end has confirmed that all details have been updated.   I will wait to see if that is true.   Watch Out For This:  Only thing is my original purchase warranty was valid till June 2020, BUT as I bought a year's extension in December 2019, my total warranty is now valid from date of purchase not date of warranty expiry - i.e. warranty valid till December 2020.   This means I lost six months warranty time... I should have waited before purchasing the extension.  So be warned not to spend your money too early if you decide to spend it at all.

I had never used something designed so poorly or something that could work tasks less efficiently than a toddler shat on your desk could do. I broke my promise to myself. I figured well HP cant be as bad as it was technology is improving and the awful memory was fading in my mind. I didn't know companies in this modern day could make a product that couldnt impress a mentally handicap donkey from the jurrasic period. This HP laptop cant even delete 20mb files in less than 10 ducking minuets. The laptop is brand new, has been checked for viruses and my WIFI is running smoothly which doesn't even matter because im deleting already downloaded stuff. HP could burn to the ground and it would be no great loss. Inserting toothpicks under my toe nails and kicking a wall would be more pleasurable than using this laptop.

I can actually get the job done about that often. Recently I've been concerned that the HP 4630 is self aware.

                HI everyone please beware of the warranty and services provided by HP India. They only try to fraud and extract money out of you. There services are pathetic and even there engineers are not qualified.  I bought my HP SPECTRE laptop from USA with 1 year of International warranty. At the end i decided to get it checked, it was working fine so the engineers suggested for an extended International warranty of 2 years for 14K so i opted for it. later my laptop showed some glitches so I called on the service center first they tried to solve it online but when it didn't work i asked for a home visit. After which people in the service center told me that it is not possible as my Laptop was bought Internationally. I mean if it cannot be serviced in India how could you charge for an extended warranty. So i asked them for the return, but then they said fine we'll send someone for a home visit.   After 2-3 days the guy came and told me that my motherboard needs to be replaced. I said ok and asked him several times if he's sure that he can get the same motherboard in India or else there's no need to replace the original motherboard but he said yes it is available and that my laptop will be as good as new again.  After that these people have been mentally harassing me for  5 months. They take my laptop return it back with unresolved issues. and they changed the motherboard number of times and kept on trying refurbished motherboard again and again. Now after all the stupid efforts and 5 months of torture they have come to a conclusion that they'll return the 14K back after spoiling my laptop and disposing my original motherboard.They made me a fool and after all this they are saying we cannot do anything about it. And now it has come to a point were i have decided to file a complaint againt these people.  So It is my humble request to all the HP users in INDIA please beware of these fraud people they claim to help you but they only believing in extracting money and torturing people. Please don't Buy any HP product.

                When you buy an HP printer, they will do everything they can to persuade/cajole you into signing up for HP Instant Ink, which is supposed to monitor your ink levels and automatically send you new cartridges when they run low.  After 2 years of paying $10/month and them only sending me replacements once--13 months ago--my yellow ink ran completely dry and they claimed I still had another one unused.  So I didn't pay and let them ""suspend"" the account.  Now they remotely locked my printer from printing and the printer directs me to log into the Instant Ink website to fix the problem.  The only way to get them to release my hostage printer is start paying them again, even though they STILL won't send me new ink because they claim I still have some unused... Now I ordered my own ink (generic, not HP, b/c F those guys!), and according to everything I'm reading, I'll still have to click an extra ""OK"" for each print job acknowledging the ink isn't ""Instant Ink!"" * 2/14/2020 Update: The generic ink works great, but I got an email yesterday from HP saying ""Thanks for updating your account info!"" which I hadn't.  They charged my credit card again, pretending I hadn't explicitly stated during a 1-hour chat with customer disservice that I will never do business with them again.  So I wasted another hour on chat, and got them to refund that charge, after which they said I'd now be charged for 2 other months, and still not get any ink for it.  So I reported the charges to my bank as fraudulent and canceled the credit card.  Go suck blood from a different turnip, HP!

What's better is Australia is not even on the list to contact and get help and only automated system for support.  Never will i buy HP again.

                HP's purchasing practice is a disaster. I will never order another product from HP. They have a practice of taking your money from your account immediately when placing an order. If anything goes wrong and the order doesn't go through it takes weeks and multiple phone calls to get them to put the money back. It took them 2 weeks and I had to make 3 phone calls and 2 conference calls with my credit card company before they finally figured out that they had to put the money back not the credit card company - sheez. I've been discouraged with the competency of the people in their sales support group. Do your self a favor and buy from anyone but HP. Been nothing but a nightmare each time I've tried to purchase from them. Never again.

                My computer just hit a year old. I had a year warranty on it. I tried to get it fixed inside my warranty gap and they tried hard to get out and see me kept bringing the wrong parts. After 3 months of them bringing the wrong parts and not getting back to me.My year was up and they told me that warranty doesn't cover it because their guys screwed up and waited too long. Now I have to pay for a fix that was covered and I had it inside the warranty. They took too long on purpose so I would have to pay but I feel like I just got cheated out of my warranty because they kept messing up. What should have been a free fix for me now will cost me $480. Used to recommend people to HP not anymore.

                Do not trust HP. I recently brought a printer [Deskjet 3700 All in one] from them which I thought was rather cheap and decent for the price. The printer worked fine for one day and the next started making misprints and missed words out. Now it won't even print anything nor accept any paper. And talk about All in One, the Scanner just stops scanning halfway through. Disappointing. I'll remember to get a Dell next time as I've never had an issues with those.

                what the hell is going on with HP UK customer service?  Couldn't find any numbers on their website and googling for customer service numbers also doesn't work. No live chat on website, only a virtual assistant. I googled ""how to speak to a person at HP"" and only the toll free US number came up. I tried that and over the course of 7 calls I got dropped once. I was given 5 different UK numbers to call. 4 of which are not recognised and the real number just rings continuously and then drops the call. Also on one of the calls the agent took my laptop model, where i'm calling from then just said he would ""look into this"" without asking why i was calling. Muted the call and took off his headset for 5 mins so I was calling down the phone to no reply.   I have yet to speak to someone at HP about my query and none of the telephone numbers I have been given work. The only real number is found by googling ""HP technical support number"" but this is the one that rings and then hangs up.  How do you speak to these people???

                So as most reviews on this garbage company mine is similar. Bought a laptop which was not a very great product to begin with. Overpriced and cheaply made. And conveniently 3 days after the laptops warranty expired I get a pop up message from hp support to restart my laptop. This message i had never seen before so i restart and then bam. It forces me to do a factory restore no other option. Then when the software attempts to reinstall it constantly gives an error message at the end and forces me to do it again.   So i get a hold of hp support and because of the 3 days operation i now have to pay 60$ just get the problem looked at it. Wether they can fix it or not. Or i have to sign up to their tech support group for 20$ a month. And the person on the phone could hardly be considered well spoken. A lot of backgrounds noise, dude had a thick accent and had the understanding of the English language as an elementary schooler. Just no help And I have a strong feeling that even if I paid into their support crap I still would not get the help I need.

                I bought an expensive (on sale for $500, regular $800) laptop from HP.com in late November 2019.  Big mistake.  If the laptop was actually ok, there wouldn't have been a problem.  Unfortunately, the screen was defective, in that it always had a bright bluish tint that made viewing white/off-white colors difficult and also caused headaches.  After trying everything (and I really mean everything) possible, the problem remained.  I chatted with HP's tech support.  Eventually, after going through everything I had already tried, they said to send the laptop in for service (something that would take weeks or longer to deal with). I didn't want to do that, and asked to just return the laptop, since I had only had the laptop for about 12 days.   The tech guy said I had to contact HP sales for that.  So, I start over. I contacted HP sales.  I go through many back &amp; forths with them via email. They apparently only have one regular sales representative, named Barbara (no last name or initial), though since her emails sometimes lack basic English writing skills, I think ""Barbara"" may be whoever answers my latest email. (However, during the worst of the communications, someone with the name Kat P [I'm not kidding] briefly took over from ""Barbara""). They ask for a case number that was never offered in any of my inquiries/chats.  I have to prove my case by sending screenshots of my chat with HP's tech guy. I ask them why they don't have their own copies of my chats with their tech support, but they never answer that question. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE SCREENSHOTS WHEN YOU CHAT WITH HP. I eventually (with my screenshots) am able to prove my case and get HP to authorize a return.  Yay!  I go to the hp.com website and submit a review for the laptop I had purchased, stating the problems I've had with HP and recommending that buyers buy their HP products from physical stores that accept returns.  A day later, HP sends me a notice that my review didn't meet their website guidelines and was not posted.  No big surprise, I guess.   I had a problem with the HP laptop I purchased.  It was probably a one-time problem, and not something most HP laptop purchasers would have to deal with. Probably, HP's products are as good as any other brands available for purchase.  But the problems they caused me when I tried to return the laptop, and their removal of my negative review from their website, have really turned me off.  No more HP products for me.

An absolute disaster upgrade onto mac catalina (just check all the complaints) and cannot get airprint to work. An absolute joke of a company, now using my Canon alternative - no problems there seamless  Avoid H-P, avoid H-P you have been warned

                Purchased an HP Omen 17 which for VR. It constantly crashes and black screens.Been sent back to HP twice and although they replaced the motherboard the first time around, they say nothing is wrong with it although we have numerous videos showing it still crashing.  We purchased extended warranty with it but HP say they will not replace or refund the laptop as their engineers say nothing is wrong with it. Shocking customer service.   We have a number of HP PC's and laptop but will not use them anymore. For anyone looking to buy an HP product for VR - DON'T. We've been using a friends MSI and this has not missed a beat so buy one of those and stay well clear of HP.

                In Short: 1. Faulty laptops with hardware problems. I got 4 to 5 bluescreens everyday. Faulty speakers. Suddenly stop working. 2. Extremely poor postsales support and long waiting times on calls. Replacement takes alot of time and effort. You’ll be calling every other day for updates on your case. 3. I was offered a repair for a brand new laptop. Do not agree to it. Ask for a replacement.  Boxing sale is coming up and you might find their deals very enticing. I purchased a spectre on black friday and recieved a faulty laptop right out the box. Its almost been a month and im still waiting for my replacement. If you have the patience to call hp everday and demand for a solution then be my guest and buckle up for a miserable experience. I had continuous blue screen errors even after all their troubleshooting and updates. The speakers stopped working too at times, until they started giving a hissing sound. I would highly suggest spending your hard earned money elsewhere if you want something that’s reliable and actually works. So far ive spent 20+ hours on call and that just helped me to get my laptop shipped after 20 days. And this was after being told for a whole week that your return label will be sent within 2 days(3 times). Im still to wait for another 10 days for the new one 😂  Bear in mind this was supposed to be their premium laptop. I would never recommend this brand to any friend or family and its been a horrible experience.   You’ve been warned! I will say however that the support staff is very polite. The only problem is that your issue takes forever to resolve. Nobody has that much time to spend on call. Luckily i had my hollidays.    EDIT: Okay. So ive waited another two weeks and i still didn’t get my laptop. Basically its almost been 45 DAYS for replacement of a faulty laptop. And upon calling them again i found out that even 14 days after receiving my laptop HP had not even processed the replacement for shipping back.  They now have both the laptop and my money and im stuck 😂 I don’t have time to deal with this stupid company anymore. I couldn’t get any work done this past month, and its very frustrating. Save yourself people. Good laptops can be bought from other brands but the customer service can not. Its been a terrible experience and HP has had the worst customer service I’ve seen in my life. Pathetic.

                HP software updates, password resets or anything web related for HP lacks any kind of basic acknowledgment. It's a pity, because the hardware HP printers are actually good. HP just need to invest in real IT staff. Their software lacks capabilities just  does not meet 2020 standards - they are really mediocre!!!

                HP are uncontactable - there is no complaints process, they just pass you off to a virtual robot or the 'community page'.   I have had a very disappointing experience with my HP Envy Printer 6230. The first problem is that the printer has had continuous connection issues right from when I first purchased it. For a printer that boasts that you 'don't need to use a USB cable to connect to your Photo 6230', I feel after my experience with it proves otherwise.   I have experienced problems such as how it often prints very slowly (sometimes taking up to 15 minutes to print a single page). It frequently started to print a page then stop halfway through leaving half a page blank (which is especially frustrating when printing on expensive HP photo paper). Sometimes it does not even respond when jobs are sent to it even though the printer's display says it is connected, it appears as 'idle' or 'unavailable' on my computer.  Another issue that I have been having with the printer is the very poor quality of printing. I have many examples of this but I will list two recent ones below:  On 11/12/19, I wasted four sheets of 5x7 photo paper trying to print a photo. When printing the first image, it gave up halfway through and left half the page blank. The other images printed with a very bizarre yellow-grey tint. It also took over 15 minutes to print a single photo on 4x6 paper, which it only printed half of again. The device said that the ink should be replaced but the connection to my computer was so poor, I could not see the supply levels so both cartridges were changed and aligned (using even more of my monthly pages up). ￼ On 17/12/19, I attempted to print off a coloured page with images and text. It did so with discoloured lines and smears across the page. It was also very slow and took over 10 minutes to print a single A4 page. Due to the smears and poor print quality, I realigned the cartridges, cleaned the back of the printer heads and cleaned the page smear using HP Utility. I attempted to print this page off several times and it was still discoloured and had strange lines down the images. One page even printed off in black and white with loads of the text missing. I wasted a total of 15 pages on HP instant ink attempting to print off this one page. I would have attached images but I could not find a complaint form which would allow me to do this.  Since first having this printer, I have spoken to many agents on web-chats but these issues are still not resolved and I have them every time I switch the printer on, wasting my money, my monthly page allowance and my very expensive photo paper and card. I waste an average of 20+ pages a month either trying to fix the printer of because it has printed pages in poor quality/not completed jobs properly. I am furious at HP and fed up of trying to sort my printer out every time I want to use it.  AVOID HP AT ALL COSTS

                I purchased an HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw Wireless Multifunction Printer with Fax - HP Store UK and exactly two months after I did so the scanner function started to fail. I spent eight hours with their Tech Support trying to fix the problem but to no avail. Then not long after while I was still trying to fix the latter problem the fuser unit and the low voltage power supply failed so I was told. I pursued HP over this matter and said that as the machine was only three months old and it now had three things wrong should it not be replaced. I was told it had to be repaired and if I did manage to get a replacement it would have to be a reconditioned one. I then had an e-mail to say that I had refused the repair which was nonsense. Once I had discovered they had blocked me from having a repair, I contacted HP again and a repair was arranged. As my work is in a home-office environment I made it clear to their booking clerk that anybody attending had to be not allergic to cats nor a smoker. When the engineer and his assistant arrived the former said he was allergic to cats and the latter was quite obviously a heavy smoker. I tried to stop them coming in but they pushed their way past me and headed for where the printer was. The engineer was then very rude to me and left the site and sent a report further insulting me and my premises. Suffice it to say the machine is still not fixed. The moral at the end of this story is avoid HP products at all costs and their service company called Hemmersbach.

                UPDATE - 27th December - Christmas come and gone HP still have not refunded or even apologised. This morning I have received an automated message saying the refund has now been actioned and will be with myself in a further 8 working days. I hope this note stops others experiencing what has happened to us.  Warning - Do not purchase HP Spectre x360 2in1, especially directly from HP Online Store.  - FYI I am still waiting and now a new excuse. Truly awful post sales and no means to escalate.   Over the black Friday weekend, I purchased about £2000, worth of laptop and accessories for work purposes. This included the HP Spectre x360 13 and  5 accessories. I received the products in a timely manner and from there on it has been an awful experience.  1. The laptop overheated within 20 minutes of powering up, this was with nothing running other than Chrome and installing updates.  2. The machine had not been updated since Apr'20. Meaning I was actually sent a laptop at least 8 months old. 3. On returning the product, HP took 4 days to arrange a pick up, it has not been 8 days and am still awaiting a refund.  The post sales team just churn out chatbot type answers, and have no empathy that the customer is out of pocket.  I regret not reading the reviews about HP aftercare service and support. If you are used to Apple then this is like going back in time when companies did not give a damn about the customer.  Avoid HP if you want to get trustworthy product and service

                All I needed was a new power cable within the warrantied timeframe. I called and they said they could easily send it but couldn't process it now because they had a system update and would call me back in 1 or 2 hours. They of course never called. I called back the next day and have been on the phone for over an hour getting transferred from person to person. They keep saying they can easily process this order but it took them a half-hour of me on the phone to do so. Hopefully, my new power cable actually arrives. I also tried to chat with a virtual agent as they suggest over the phone but it just stopped responding and never answered any questions.   I've always purchased HP products but will certainly avoid doing so from now on.

                HP is one of the worst companies to deal with.  I ordered the ENVY desktop.  I had a customized order... they forgot to put the speakers into the desktop... so I call them, they will replace it, however they NEED TO CHARGE ME FOR ANOTHER $600 DESKTOP!!!  Once I get the correct desktop and send the one without the speakers back, then they will credit my card for the cost of 1 desktop!!  A week before Christmas and they want payment for 2 desktops to FIX THEIR ERROR!!!  i am going to write reviews all over the internet to stop people from buying from them!!  The company could have said --we will send the new desktop and if you don't send the first desktop back, then we will charge your card for it...  The customer service person didn't even miss a beat when I told her I was sending it back and would buy from another company!!  She said I will send you the return ticket for the desktop to be sent back......  POS COMPANY

                First time ordering my ink cartridges directly from HP Canada. When I received my package there was only 2 out of 3 ink cartridges and the packing slip said 3 were packed. I called customer service and they kept me on hold for a very long time then said they have to investigate and I should get an email within 24-48 hrs. Nothing! I called again, left in hold for long time then said the same thing they have to investigate and shld get an email within 24-48 hrs Nothing! So I emailed sales and they said I need to check with Canada Post - no, the package was sealed tightly. The problem came from whoever was in charge of packaging. They said they need to investigate but will now take 10-15 days! Most companies apologize and send the missing item right away!! Now I have to wait 2-3 weeks for an answer and can’t print and I have already paid for these ink cartridges... shame on you HP!!

                I recently bought a HP 17-BY0001TX 4DQ72PA 17.3""FHD Core i5-8250U 2G-AMD Radeon 530 8GB 2TB DVD W10, the issue I have with the laptop is that the left hand hinge has become loose over  a short period of time  through regular opening and closing of the laptop this has cracked the base also, I have contacted HP regarding warranty as the laptop is only 6 months old, and the damage  is not through abuse or any type of impact if it was I would have claimed it on my home insurance.  This is where the problem begins. HP requested photos to assess the laptop and advise what course of action I should take, they have basically told me it is my problem and they will not cover the repair, I asked to be put further up the line to talk to someone but was given the same blunt answer that it is my fault, then they offered to repair it and do the labour for free, they wanted me to pay for the parts, the parts estimate was $300, I found the parts online for around $100 so I can only assume they wanted to get their labour fee paid for also. I have had numerous contacts with their warranty service  with no success and having the same thing repeated to me every time like a broken record, I can only assume that is what they are taught at the  GFY warranty school at HP, I have looked online and found numerous laptops made by HP with hinge issues and various complaints regarding this issue but I have been told that my laptop is not one of the ones suffering from this issue, surprise surprise. So in closing if you want to buy a laptop and want any sort of after sales service or quality ""STAY AWAY FROM HEWLETT PACKARD""!!!! this has been the worst experience I have ever had with any purchase I have ever made in the 50 years I have been on the planet, I have had numerous laptops over the years and never had such a flimsy poorly constructed piece of s**t before.

However, I made a mistake that I did not read carefully with description on CPU that this laptop has AMD on it.  I called customer service talked to Maria Stuart (I don't think that she gave me a real name) to get full refund because it was not even started on assembling when I check my order status.  I called and talked to her and she said that it is already being built. I am pretty sure that she was lying, trained by her manager, don't get any refunds or returns. I ordered roughly 2 hours ago, and they got all the parts and started on ??  This is ridiculous.  I have all the records that I need to prove that when I ordered and when I made a call to cancel.  I tried different customer services even chat on line. All the customer service reps are saying that I have to wait and it is not guaranteed to get canceled.  I have previous experience on HP products and I liked it. However, customer service was horrible. It turned me down so hard.  Read carefully or you have to take the product no matter what. Once they get the money transferred, you will not get refund  HP company has horrible customer services.

                I purchased a HP laptop in September of 2018. November 2019, the touch screen was acting up.  I called customer support to find out I had to PAY to talk to someone!  Absolutely RIDICULOUS to have to pay to speak with support after you've purchased their product!  DO NOT purchase from HP.  The laptop I purchased is JUNK, broke after 14 months.  My previous laptop from Sony (which I purchased this one to replace)   lasted 7 years, and is still working.  HP lasted 14 months.  JUNK!  Beware!

                I recently purchased the HP Pavilion x360 14-dh0025na Convertible Laptop and I am thoroughly disappointed with it.  One day after using it, the laptop began to make a lot of noise especially when I began to charge it. It continued to make these loud noises which would be expected from an old laptop (maybe 4/5 years old) however this was a brand new laptop! Upon reporting this to the hp store, I got it exchanged however, the second laptop is exactly the same and noisy which makes one wonder what's wrong with the laptop.

                I have an HP Envy, and it's been one issue after another. After 4 months, I had to send the wifi connector hardware to be replaced since it would cut in and out incessantly. My sound only works half the time, and I have to restart the computer to get the speaker to work again. The fan is LOUD, especially when plugged in charging. Good luck getting help through the phone service. You'll speak to 5 different people and get nowhere. Do not buy laptops from them.

                What on Earth has happened to this once great brand? I'm a HP business partner and supplied a colour Laserjet All in One to a cistomer 6 weeks ago. It's been playing up from day 1 and now is finally dead. Calls to HP warranty had them pretending they needed the suppliers invoice from the Channel reseller, not the end user invoice, then the customer was told she'd get a second hand replacement for her 50 print weeks old brand new printer. Eventually I stepped in and haven ow been waiting 3 days for their ""customer relations"" team to actually speak to me. After 48 hours they left a message whilst I was on the phone. The message stated I could not call them back and had to wait for them to call me again. Almost 36 hours later, 3 emails and 2 calls to HP Warranty, who also claim to be unable to talk to their customer relations team, I'm still waiting. It's quite clear leaving a voicemail allows them to ignore you for another 48 hours, from their French based ""UK Customer Relations"" Office. Edit - 6 days on and I finally get a call from their customer relations, who basically tell me I've been wasting my time. I now need to buy the customer a new replacement at my expense and will have to take the second hard warranty exchange unit in return. That's me and HP finished. 15 years as a business partner but your customer service now stinks. I couldn't treat my customers that way and stay in business, so won't be helping yours any longer.

                I've had Hewlett Packard (HP) printers before - and they were fine. However, I got fed up running out of ink and decided to join their subscription ink service. Unfortunately, the two HP printers I owned were not compatible and I needed to buy a new model. All was OK for a few weeks, then it began dropping the wireless connection. This would happen four or five times every evening. Initially, I thought my BT was the problem, but I checked it out and all was good It became clear that the HP Envy was dropping connection because it was being sent firmware updates from HP's ink servers and would crash every time. I logged a complaint with HP, escalating through first line, tech support and finally customer relations management. After many lengthy calls and doing everything they asked, they finally sent me another printer - but within weeks of arrival, it began doing the same thing, I complained again, and ended up talking to a Max F - who said I had to do a firmware update using a USB cable - I argued that a wireless printer shouldn't need a USB update. He closed the complaint. I reopened it - he closed it again.  I didn't use the printer much but finally I got so fed up, I bought a USB cable and did the firmware upgrade - it failed!! SO I reopened the complaint. After much faffing about they finally sent me a new printer - but it wasn't new - it was a repaired 2nd hand model. I said I wanted a new printer - they referred me to their T&amp;C's. I referred them to the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 - that clearly stipulates that if a replacement for a faulty item is subsequently found to be defective - then I have a right to full refund OR ""a price reduction if you wish to keep the product"" The 'gentleman' from HP said 'Don't care' take it or leave it - and when I said I wanted a new printer or a reduced price and access to the ink service - he closed the case and hung up. It's not over until the fat lady sings and I'm getting really annoyed now.....!!! If you have a choice - Avoid HP - their CRM's are high handed, rude, and are not UK based -  when I declined to accept his omnipotence and asked for escalation, said he was the end of the line...he clearly doesn't know me, p.s. I gave one star because I don't think I can give no stars - caveat emptor

                There's a reason they score 1.5 stars out of 5!!!! A shambles of a company who sell inherently faulty products and try to obfuscate responsibility when their merchandise fails!! I note a few reviews on here saying the hard drive has failed. Same happened to me within  3 months of purchase, gave them the opportunity to fix it, they collected and returned it in a worse state.  Knowing my consumer rights I demanded my money back .  They eventually agreed and collected the faulty laptop.......4 WEEKS ago and I am still waiting for my £500 back!  101 excuses as to why they haven't given me my refund.  THIS IS THEFT IN MY BOOK. So I have decided to take them to court to recover my money.    Trading Standards need to intervene and look at the way this company operates.  Quite rare for a company of this global magnitude to have such pitiful and scathing reviews.  I have included the UK MD George Brasher and the CEO Enrique Lores on my emails......they need to be made aware of the embarrassing, substandard service they are providing. This is a condensed version of events  - far too exhausting to relay.  ***STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY THEY WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF.  KNOW YOUR CONSUMER RIGHTS YOU WILL NEED THEM***

                I have an Envy 6234 printer: endless problems printing. I am unable to make a stable connection between my desktop and the printer: I have had to download the printer app from HP on 6 occasions in the past two years. I am repeatedly bombarded with requests to load paper even when I am not using the printer!    The photocopier is good - but then I can get one of those from another system. I will not be buying HP products again after this experience.

                I purchased two ink cartridges for my HP x476w printer, part number 970XL.  when I received them two days later I noticed that the expiry date/ warranty date was only 6 months stamped on the box. Meanwhile I ordered two other cartridges at the same time from Amazon their expiry date was 2 years. When I called HP to inquire why they were sending me old stock their only reply was I had two choices return the product or take a chance that they will last.so I decided to ask for a return label to return the product since I paid close to $300 for them. I have now been waiting 3 weeks to get a return label to return the product every time I call they tell me they will send it this has been the fourth time I've called. It looks like they do not want me to return this product. Do not order from HP directly all their ink products are out of date.  Order from Amazon.

                I will never buy another HP again I bought a new HP 15 laptop less than 3 months ago, surprise surprise the hard drive already fried itself. Contacted HP, I paid to have it sent in and repaired lo and behold its not covered under WARRANTY(even though I checked with customer support over any possible damage which I was told everything was covered) after wanting over $400 dollars in repairs due to liquid damage?!, I opted out decided to have it sent back and cut my losses. Customer service will only give you the run around and I still dont have my paperweight back yet.

                I recently bought a HP 17-BY0001TX 4DQ72PA 17.3""FHD Core i5-8250U 2G-AMD Radeon 530 8GB 2TB DVD W10, the issue I have with the laptop is that the left hand hinge has become loose over  a short period of time  through regular opening and closing of the laptop this has cracked the base also, I have contacted HP regarding warranty as the laptop is only 6 months old, and the damage  is not through abuse or any type of impact if it was I would have claimed it on my home insurance.  This is where the problem begins. HP requested photos to assess the laptop and advise what course of action I should take, they have basically told me it is my problem and they will not cover the repair, I asked to be put further up the line to talk to someone but was given the same blunt answer that it is my fault, then they offered to repair it and do the labour for free, they wanted me to pay for the parts, the parts estimate was $300, I found the parts online for around $100 so I can only assume they wanted to get their labour fee paid for also. I have had numerous contacts with their warranty service  with no success and having the same thing repeated to me every time like a broken record, I can only assume that is what they are taught at the  GFY warranty school at HP, I have looked online and found numerous laptops made by HP with hinge issues and various complaints regarding this issue but I have been told that my laptop is not one of the ones suffering from this issue, surprise surprise. So in closing if you want to buy a laptop and want any sort of after sales service or quality ""STAY AWAY FROM HEWLETT PACKARD""!!!! this has been the worst experience I have ever had with any purchase I have ever made in the 50 years I have been on the planet, I have had numerous laptops over the years and never had such a flimsy poorly constructed piece of s**t before.

SO I reopened the complaint. After much faffing about they finally sent me a new printer - but it wasn't new - it was a repaired 2nd hand model. I said I wanted a new printer - they referred me to their T&amp;C's. I referred them to the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 - that clearly stipulates that if a replacement for a faulty item is subsequently found to be defective - then I have a right to full refund OR ""a price reduction if you wish to keep the product"" The 'gentleman' from HP said 'Don't care' take it or leave it - and when I said I wanted a new printer or a reduced price and access to the ink service - he closed the case and hung up. It's not over until the fat lady sings and I'm getting really annoyed now.....!!! If you have a choice - Avoid HP - their CRM's are high handed, rude, and are not UK based -  when I declined to accept his omnipotence and asked for escalation, said he was the end of the line...he clearly doesn't know me, p.s. I gave one star because I don't think I can give no stars - caveat emptor

                I have an Envy 6234 printer: endless problems printing. I am unable to make a stable connection between my desktop and the printer: I have had to download the printer app from HP on 6 occasions in the past two years. I am repeatedly bombarded with requests to load paper even when I am not using the printer!    The photocopier is good - but then I can get one of those from another system. I will not be buying HP products again after this experience.

                I purchased two ink cartridges for my HP x476w printer, part number 970XL.  when I received them two days later I noticed that the expiry date/ warranty date was only 6 months stamped on the box. Meanwhile I ordered two other cartridges at the same time from Amazon their expiry date was 2 years. When I called HP to inquire why they were sending me old stock their only reply was I had two choices return the product or take a chance that they will last.so I decided to ask for a return label to return the product since I paid close to $300 for them. I have now been waiting 3 weeks to get a return label to return the product every time I call they tell me they will send it this has been the fourth time I've called. It looks like they do not want me to return this product. Do not order from HP directly all their ink products are out of date.  Order from Amazon.

                I received an HP laptop for Christmas as a gift to be used for my college classes as I am an online student. I worked well for the first semester (4 months) but then it stopped working. I would write a paper and the tab would shut itself down. It would not allow me to restore it meaning I lost an hours worth of hard work. This continued to happen on many occasions. Another issue arose with storage. It would say I had no disk space to download the power points I needed. I cleared all of my photos, downloads, documents, and so forth but it still didn't allow me any more space on the disk. Don't get me started on the internet speed and processing that the computer lack. Never buying from the brand again.

                I have never in my life been so disgusted with a company before. I purchased a brand new computer on 9/30/2019. A little over two weeks I was unable to power it on. I called support and they took me through several steps, none of which were successful in rebooting the computer. Support told me to send in the computer and they would repair it. The expected date of return changesd from 10/31 to Dec 6. I called and complained and the said they would send me a refurbished computer. This was a 2 week old computer that I paid 700 dollars for. Seriously???? After squawking loud enough, they agreed to send me a new computer.  Not the same one, but at least a new one. They continue to put me off, its 11/13/2019 and still no tracking number, still no computer. Do NOT do business with this company.

                My printer died and I bought an HP as a quick replacement. I was happy with it so I kept it. Then it suddenly would not scan to PDF. They replaced the printer 'upgraded' to 5200 series. I had to send the old one back. They did not receive it in time so they made a huge fuss. The printer would not configure to wireless and it took a supervisor on my computer to configure it. Then it was enrolled in instant ink. They sent ink. Then the paper tray malfunctioned and again they replaced the printer. It wouldn't use the instant ink cartridges. They sent me new ones (supposedly non-instant ink). It printed maybe 2 pages and now it says it won't print on instant ink (cartridges are not supposed to be instant ink). Again it won't do wireless and it won't print. I have a business to run and don't have time for this. To add injury to injury they didn't get the old printer back in time and charged me $135 - the agreement for such default was $50.. I had to go to office depot to print my shipping labels and bought an *Epson* printer while I was there. HP is marginal at best.  A large loss of time and money and larger gain of stress. They are never open 4 help and when I tried the automated thing it said the warranty expired Sept 27. I got the printer Oct 5. They are a mess.

After a long process they agreed to fix it. 3 weeks later when I get my laptop back from a 3rd party vendor HP outsource their repairs to its all wiped (thats fine I backed it up). It seems as though they replace the whole keyboard a cover (My intel/graphics stickers were gone). Then some of the keyboard keys start to stick on me and the battery seems to die waaay too quickly. It was never like this. I only have myself to blame really on this one for buying a HP.

                Hello. I use to be a fan of HP but absolutely no more. I purchased an HP 14-ax020wm Stream Notebook 14"" N3060 1.6 Ghz 4GB RAM 32gb eMmc Win10-Purple on October 22, 2019, on-line. It was so slow, I couldn't even go to google.com, facebook.com, etc. I was unable to get to any website fast. Couldn't even upload or download anything within a reasonable amount of time. (I have been in tech for 3 decades)  So I called for support and we did the normal, unsuccessfully. We rebooted the laptop. We disconnected the wifi and re-enabled it. We unplugged the router, waited 2 minutes, and plugged the router back it. All to no avail.   The technician said this is normal. The hard drive could be full. I just purchased the laptop and couldn't access the web to download anything to fill it up.   Needless to say, I told him I want my money back. He said I am out of my warranty date and it couldn't be returned. 16 days after purchasing an HP laptop, I was out of the warranty. I started to flip.    I called On 11/7/2019 and asked to return or exchange the laptop. HP told me the warranty was for 15 days, so they said I was unable to return it. I expressed my dissatisfaction with them, their laptop and their warranty and every policy they have ever written that has gotten them to this point in history.   Therefore, please read this HP Laptops Review, Hewlett-Packard Laptop Review or whatever we can call it so others can find the truth about my experience with HP laptops.

                If I could give my HP laptop zero stars I would do so. Also wish I'd read these reviews first!   I bought my laptop at a cost of £299 just over a month ago from Argos in Edinburgh.  It was fine for about two weeks then began to get slower and slower to do anything and also the screen kept freezing. Tried contacting HP customer support but, apart from having problems understanding what the Chinese lady adviser was saying (it didn't help that she had a cold and sniffed loudly and repeatedly throughout the conversation), got absolutely nowhere. Their technical support team never got back to me either as she said they would. Took it to Argos who said all they could do was to return it to HP for them to have a look at it, but having by now little faith in HP I took it to my usual computer repair man who I've been dealing with for several years now and whose charges are very reasonable.  I was absolutely appalled though when he told me that the problem lay with the hard drive which he said was ""worn out"". I know the laptop was cheap but to be practically useless after only four weeks' usage beggars belief!!  It's now costing me £100 to have the hard drive replaced, which is my only option since as I only have my state pension plus a very small amount of savings I cannot afford the price of another new laptop.  He also told me that although HP used to be a reliable make, their products have gone rapidly downhill in recent years and wouldn't recommend them to anyone, yet stores throughout the UK continue to sell this trash.

The Person Mr. Yogesh visited my place on 18th October 2019. he said now your printer is showing F4 error and you have to replace door sensor. you  receive quotation against this and then you can order that part. I am trying again to Mr Sandesh and Suntiha (Thane) for the same. upto now no one has responded also not received any mail from your side. almost 17days has passed now. no quotation, no response to phone call.Mr Yogesh said if you order this part separately you will receive it on next day itself i.e on 19th October. But as I wanted to go with your service I am facing this trouble. really shame on you people. You dont follow the process designed by company. as a result customers are facing problems.

                Bought a new laptop for my wife just over a year ago and spilt beer on it, everything worked except the mouse key. Had a quote and told many parts needed to be replaced (although only the key not working) and better to buy a new laptop. So I did. Separately I bought the same type online whilst in Italy last year. After 10 months the mouse key broke (it physically broke and flops from side to side as if a spring has broken). Had it checked and told that the key is integral to the whole board and cannot just be replaced, it would be very expensive and better really to get a new laptop. Final point is that we are back in Italy now for 6 months so not easy to get back to PC World where my wife's 3 month old laptop was bought and her mouse key did exactly the same thing last night. Have just discovered it is impossible to get an email address for HP. The quality of product is terrible and designed in today's disposable society - DON'T REPAIR, JUST BUY NEW! Contacting someone to raise the issue is also deliberately made as difficult as possible.

                Whatever you do, do not buy an HP printer. The worse product experiences of my life. Their customer service do their best to be helpful and kind but the company products themselves simply do not work. I bought the printer a few months ago, in that time the printer was replaced 3 times by the company every time for a different technical glitch. All times I was able to use printer for no more than a couple pages. I enrolled in their instant ink program for which I now have boxes of ink that doesn't work. This means that I spent HOURS on the phone with their customer service, as well as time handling their printers to be shipped back. Factoring in the price of the printer and ink, as well as the time lost dealing with their technical issues, this company has cost me a LOT more than if I had paid an outside printing service. Case manager suppose to call me to handle a full refund. Absolutely not worth it. A real liability.

                Several problems with customer service ending in the refusal to repair my laptop. On October 8, 2019, I sent in my laptop for repair. the only issue it was having was black, grey and white lines on the monitor. I received a call a week later that said I had liquid damage. I had no memory of any liquid being spilled, but my husband had traveled with it a week earlier, so it wasn't in my control the entire time. They wanted to charge $700 to repair it. I called back to decline based on the cost. They then offered a discounted repair price of $400. They left a message saying I had 24 hours to accept the repair. The associate Gabby called me and left a message. I called and emailed back within the 24 hour time frame. However, I didn;t hear back from her until another 3 days when she left me another message saying that they were mailing it back even though she had received my messages. I called back and spoke to another associate. She had told me hours later that they were able to stop it from being mailed out and would repair it. Additionally, she would offer me a further discount of $365 for all of my trouble. I agreed and gave her my credit card info. She didn't ask me for my address and the first charge didn't go through. She apologized and took my address correctly a second time. Afterwards, there was a $365 hold on my bank account. The next day, I received another call from Gabby this time. She said the charge didnt go through and they needed to put another $365 hold on my credit card. I refused. The next day, I recieved a phone call from the other agent who said due to all my problems, they would fix the laptop at no charge. I thanked her and agreed. There was an estimated date of repair as 11.1.19. I called today after no update and was told the laptop was beyond economic repair. The agent Omar told me that the cost to repair the laptop was about half the cost of the laptop (around the original $700). He said they were mailing it back to me. Of course, no one had contacted me to tell me this information. I asked to speak to a supervisor, Hannah. who told me that they don't know the exact cost until the actual repair and several components were damaged and they were mailing it back. They did not offer any information about these components. They did not agree to work with me to repair the laptop and are mailing it back. The extremely long list of errors makes me doubt the veracity of HP. I was told it would be repaired free of charge due to their errors. There was no caveat that it was contingent upon further inspection.

                I have owned an HP OfficeJet 6950 printer for just over two years. The cartridges have worked well and been replaced by post efficiently. I only print fewer that 50 pages per month and I find the annual cost of just under £24 very good.   The downside of HP is their poor explanation of procedures. They recently sent me an email recommending a new website for accessing your Instant Ink account. I found the prominent log-in icon led to an error message. After hours of struggle I contacted online chat and received irrelevant advice.They were obviously not understanding the problem and trying to get rid of me. I then phoned and a very competent person advised me to use the HP Smart app *not the website) and ignore the log-in but just click on ""Get Instant Ink"" instead. She was right.   I cannot really recommend HP these days (after happy memories of Deskjet 500 twenty years ago). Probably best to shop around for a firm with a better reputation and reasonable costs. My old Lexmark printer was very easy to use and caused few problems but the cartridges were expensive.

I have contacted them about it and received nothing but a runaround (imagine that?) today is 29 October 2019, when ordered I selected 2 to 4 days priority mail, ""what mail"" they replied! You are getting the thing electronically, not through the mail. That's fine, save HP another couple of bucks for sending out a hard copy. But, where does the 2 to 4 days come in? Each time I check the status, it is stuck on shipping (since 13 October by the way) sending it electronically? Now, I ask all of you, couldn't that be done rather fast nowadays? I know that HP doesn't read any of there reviews, because most of them are negative and if they would have read them, any of them, you'd think by now they would have tried, in the very least to make things better for the consumers that still purchase the HP products. I for one will no be purchasing any other product made by HP and I sure as heck will never purchase a warranty of any sort from these people!

                I just threw my HP 1510 in the trash.  I wouldn't dare donating it to a thrift store and exposing someone else to the harassment of perfectly printing a page and then being blocked because the cartridge failed and needs to be replaced.  I don't know how many times I went through this procedure, wasting countless hours.  Some people on the Internet came up with procedures to block these error messages, including taping a certain cartridge contact.  I don't need that crap from a company that calls itself Hewlett Packard, once a reputable manufacturer.  I am done with them; never ever again!

                Upon registration, the warranty remaining stated '4 months'.  I am supposed to have one year.  I contacted support on the day I purchased my printer.  It also stated something about the original purchase was 2/2/19.  (I didn't know HP sold returned or used printers as new!!)  I sent a copy of my receipt, as requested, showing the purchase date of 10/18/19 and was told the problem would be taken care of in not more than 72 hours.  A couple of days later, I registered for the Instant Ink program.  I was supposed to have a $40 credit to allow 8 months of free ink.  Upon registration I found out I only had two months remaining.  (Second problem on HP.  What a joke of a company.)  The first time I called support, I spent two hours on the problem.  I was not going to do this again.  I simply returned the printer.  This was my first and LAST HP purchase.  Burn me once, shame on you.  Burn me twice, shame on me.  It appears you burned me twice.  I will never give HP another chance to burn me again.

                HP are forcing people to use only their mega-expensive original inks! HP pushed an update to printers on the internet (and most of us have our printer online there days) - blocking people from using non-original cartridges. How greedy does a company need to be, to force people to use their extremely expensive inks? I get that you don't want printers with a warranty using inferior ink, but ultimately it's my printer and I should be free to use the inks I choose. I won't even consider paying the £90 (that's more than the printer cost!) for ink - my 18 month old printer is being thrown out and replaced with a product that is cheaper to feed.

                *You couldn't pay me to even refer HP to anyone* I've had a HORRIBLE experience with my HP ENVY Photo 7855 all-in-one. It started fine, all I needed at the time was the printing function. I knew the scanning would come in the future so I planned to download the software at that time. Well, that time has come and I can NOT get the software. The support rep at HP was very kind but could find no resolve other than I need to have a faster connection. She tried to make it seem that was a hindrance to me printing as well but my connection is as strong as it can possibly get and I have NEVER had a problem with my connection being ""too slow"". So basically between me spending an hr attempting to navigate through their overly complex site and being on the phone, I've wasted almost 3 hrs of my day and find that I can not work!

                I bought a HP ENVY laptop and shortly after purchase one of the keys popped off. To get this repaired they would not just send me a new key to press on they insisted it had to be sent back to the factory for repair. Eventually I did this and the laptop was operational again. A little while later the sound stopped. If I removed the driver and restarted then the sound would return for a little while. After much discussion I now have to send the computer back to them again. I feel that I have a useless expensive pile of junk which I would love to replace but it's not that old. I bought an expensive model so that it wouldn't be outdated quickly. I'll NEVER buy anything HP again

                So my laptop had to be repaired and it took at least two months for them to finally take my computer to their repair place and the WhatsApp customer care service took ages to res[pnd to what I said, and after I paid $450 to try and get the whole laptop fixed, it comes back with a broken USB port, several scratches on the cover and had only fixed the side of the computer for $450 dollars! I don't understand why people think HP is good, and it is the worst and slowest customer care services I have ever faced.

                I would give a zero star if I could. From what I gather, they will only help you if you purchase something that you don't need. Firstly, I can hardly understand what anyone is saying. Secondly, I told them that I just purchased this laptop and is fully aware that there's no virus on it. They're liars and solely here to make a sell. Dam

                They shouldn't call it customer service because it's nonexistent.   I purchased an HP laptop notebook 2 months ago. I called customer service to have them reset my laptop to factory settings as I forgot my logon password and they refused. They told me my warranty for software had expired! I said that was impossible as I just purchased the laptop from Amazon. They said the only way they could help was if paid them for support!! I find that incredibly greedy and absolutely unacceptable!! Fortunately, Amazon is reimbursing me. Due to this experience I will never purchase another HP product again!!!

                Bought a HP OfficeJet 5220 All-in-One Printer/Scanner. Straight out of the box with the setup cartridges that came with it and you have to use to set up the printer, It did not work. Kept telling me to use other cartridges. I called customer services only to have them try to tell me it was a used printer when I literally just opened the box and took the printer and the cartridges out of it's original packing. I told them as such and they began troubleshooting, which just involved me taking the cartridges in and out which I had already tried. He said they were sending me new cartridges as I am under warranty. The guy on the phone guessed my last name when I said it instead of just asking what it was and sent UPS to my building for a package to Daniel Flemo which is not my name. UPS obviously could not find me in the directory (as my name is Danielle Palermo and nowhere close to Flemo) and did not deliver the package. When I called to figure out what was going on, I was told to call UPS myself to figure it out. I told them to do it themselves as I was not the one who sent out the package to begin with, I didn't even have the tracking number. They said they fixed it, which they did not as on Monday, I got an email saying Daniel Flemo could not be delivered a package (which they sent to my email which is my god damn name). I called UPS myself and cleared it up, I am still unable to print and have not received the cartridges. It should not be this difficult to get a printer working. The support workers barely do their job and the products don't work out of the box apparently. I basically had to complain till they did their job, which they still could not accomplish. If you want things done, do it yourself, cause HP customer service sure isn't going to do it for you.

                I have had three HP laptops. The first two lasted less than 24 months so I decided to go with the expensive high-end Spectre model. Within the first year, it had to be sent to HP for power issues. Then warranty ran out, the issue came back and now they are charging me almost 500 to fix it. The issue is a design error (charger port) that was later corrected on future models. No responsibility for quality. The laptop is less than 24 months old and worthless. DONE with this brand.

It hangs up multiple times but i kept calling anyway and it finally went through. The first person hung up on me so I had to call 12x again just to get through. Finally reached someone who i thought was really helpful but the problem wasn't resolved. He refused to replace my printer even though it's under warranty. He wants me to go waste more money on ink and try to print again even though we've spent so much money on ink already and IT'S NOT PRINTING!!! He was suppose to be getting a supervisor on the phone, but instead he hung up on me AGAIN! WORST COMPANY EVER. I've wasted so much money. Our doctor's office hasn't been able to print for 2 weeks now and were just getting the run around. DO NOT CHOOSE HP.

                Worst experience ever! I bought a HP pavilion x360 convertible laptop in August from India. One of the reasons I selected HP is it's international warranty since I moved to Dublin, Ireland after buying it. In less than 2 months the laptop suddenly died and stopped responding. customer care representatives said that it will take upto a month to get it fixed after it reaches them. Refused to provide any sort of replacement (permanent/ temporary) during that period. Then it took them a whole week just to get it picked up (had to stay home till then) After following up aggressively I was promised that the laptop will reach me by 15th Oct. Then today, again they pushed the date to 18th Oct. I am not sure if it's the final one. Better to get MacBook instead. This model was not very cheap either! Also, when I asked for the channel to escalate, HP watsapp chat support executive said there is no way to do so! Highly inconvenient and worst experience I ever had.

                Owned a new HP Printer with the instant ink deal for exactly two hours . The online automated help could not help. I could not connect to the internet therefore could not proceed with the setup instructions. The automated help could not help with this scenario . I had no option  other than to put everything back in the box and send it back , I am 53 years old ,maybe to old for HP products .

                If I could give no stars!! Shockingly bad service! I had to cancel my HP instant ink service because I've moved country and they do not provide these services here, so I went out and bought brand new HP cartridges, got home, put them in, and it says incompatible. I went on to HP support for this country and got put through to an English speaking team who told me that because I was contacting them on a Saturday they would have to contact me back on Monday as my problem is printer related. Monday by 5pm nobody had contacted me so I replied to the same chat asking for help again and they asked me to allow them a few minutes to read previous messages. I still heard nothing back on Monday, so Tuesday I contacted again and they told me that the printer team have logged out and they will contact me today. At 9:13 this morning they messaged me back finally and because I didn't reply for half an hour they had the cheek to chase me up! When I replied to say I still needed help they told me that I have been misrouted to the incorrect support team and told me to message a different number. So I messaged the other team who then replied to my message in a different language and then told me that if I wanted to speak to an English service team to contact a different number, the number they gave me was to the previous team that told me to contact them! So when I went to message them again they told me that they were the wrong team and disconnected the chat! I've since gone online to see if I can get help from the UK site through a VPN service and am still being passed around to different teams!! The problem is still not resolved and am starting to think that it won't be! I've had enough of all this and am now thinking I might buy a new printer that isn't HP as the service is so awful and am not sure what else to do!!!!

                Disgusting Customer Service!  I ordered a laptop with a delivery estimate of 48 hours, that changed to 5-10 working days on order completion. I received an email saying the product would be with me on the 8th October. Then when I checked the website the estimated deliver was changed to the 24th October? On the 7th October I called HP only to find that the 24th is another estimate and I may not receive the product for months as they cannot guarantee delivery? They took full payment on the date I ordered, and I think it is disgusting that they are still advertising a time of 5-10 days on the product I ordered, when they have none in stock and admitted they do not know when they will be back in stock? The person I spoke to sounded monotone and did not care a hoot about the delay, they offered to cancel the order, and that was their solution. Disgraceful way to run a business - avoid!

                I bought a top of the line HP ENVY just over a year ago. I only used it for work. Today, I opened the top and the screen completely separated from the backing and a hinge completely broke. It seemed perfectly fine yesterday. I contacted HP and they said the warranty was expired and it would be $400 to repair. The laptop broke by OPENING it up. You're supposed to open it to use it (duh). And by opening it up, it broke after just over a year? Worthless garbage. Get something more durable.

                I wish i could give them zero stars. Their customer services is beyond a joke. They hide behind the fact that you can not call them directly and when you call the only number they give you, the persons says that they will email the right department and ask them to call you back, which they do not. I am disgusted with the time it is taking to sort this issue and with the far below sub standard service that this company provide. I tried using the WhatsApp option and they took 30 minutes between messages. I have purchased many HP products for myself and my company and i can honestly say that they will never get another penny from me and i will gladly share my experience with everyone from friends, colleagues and even clients. My laptop was a top end Spectre 360 and it has failed 3 times in 10 months, causing much stress. They never seem to appreciate that when you have travel visas and important information needed to other companies projects and activities, the loss of access to this data can have huge repercussions. I am utterly disgusted by this company.

                I bought HP Envy X360 two weeks back from their online sales here in Australia; now the display/screen turns dark and flickers intermittently when the power cord is disconnected from the laptop, when I called for the support services, India based technical representative said that, they cannot send a technician over for a repair and hence need to spend a whole day waiting for a courier to show up and pick up this piece of junk (no, they will not let me drop this junk to the nearby post office at my convenience, rather they want me to take a whole day off to wait for the courier guy to arrive), the repair service may require another 7/8 days for repair and yet another 2/4 days for delivery. What could be worse than this? I will be without a laptop for the next 11 days. I'm really missing the touch of quality here, which I received from Dell Australia. I bought a dell laptop overseas and when I came here in Australia, it stopped working due to a major hardware issue, I called Dell and within 10 minutes of my call, they created a service order number and sent the repair guy the very next day. I would not recommend anyone to buy HP products anymore. As I'm still under the cooling-off/chance of mind time frame, I will try to get a full refund back, if not possible, I shall escalate this issue with the NSW fair trading which checks on the unscrupulous traders.  I have all the proofs (invoices, email history) if anyone wants to see. Please make sure that no-one buys HP products anymore unless they don't care what they are buying

                Do not buy their 'care pack'. The advertising is fraudulent, misleading, dishonest etc.... It specifically states that 'accidental damage' and 'spillages' are covered. They still refuse to do any repairs and they lie repeatedly in their reasons for refusal, changing to a new excuse after each reason is proven invalid.

                Most appalling customer service system I have yet to come across. If I could give it 0 stars I would but had to select at least 1 to leave a review.   Bought laptop off them which was dysfunctional and had to be returned. Thought it was just bad luck so paid extra £200 to have better model so £500 in total for basic model but it still crashes regularly but now is too late to return so am stuck with it as alternative is me trying to get through to customer service....which is what has prompted this review.  Bought printer that was peer reviewed and had excellent feedback. My experience was terrible though, would not install fully and would not work properly even once HP staff had taken over by remote assistance.  Trying to get to that point took two days though. First time waiting over 2.5 hours on their 'quick' What's App contact but getting no response at all. Simultaneously phoned them and got through quicker there, just over 40 mins, to be told it sounded like a driver error and then have my call cut off. Immediately rung back but automated message telling me they were now closed for day so I had clearly been cut off deliberately.  Following day waited hours again, What's App, phone, and Facebook messenger. Operative I eventually spoke to was as helpful as they could be but wait was appallingly slow.  Requested postal or email address for complaints, no such thing. Gave me a phone number instead. I just laughed! Exactly why they get away with reviews not truly representing how poor their service is as it's clearly made deliberately difficult to make a complaint. Will never buy a product of theirs again and have advised everyone I know to do the same.

                Terrible experience!!! Don't buy HP!!!   I bought HP Spectre X360 in July 2019.  It works for a month.  Then USB-C stop working.   When you pick up a phone or use chat, you are never able to talk to a live person.   HP only has one authorized service center, Micro Center, in Tustin CA in great LA area (all others listed in HP's website are phony).  So I brought my computer to Micro Center.  It took them two weeks to fix the problem because HP was not responsive in shipping the replacement part of the board for USB-C.  Now the board got replaced and USB-C ports work.  But the HDMI and printer functions do not work.  It was working fine for a month before.  New problems keep coming up and I got no HP person to give me help.  It is a terrible experience.

After 23 years of only buying HP computers and having bad service and computers, I just had to tell how bad it has been and why my next computer will be a MAC or if there is something else that I can configure to what I need that would work too! I thought I would never say that. I am so tired of the nonsense and products that HP are putting out. I spend more time shutting things down and getting rid of apps that they put on the computer. I know most of the apps allow open doors to track and take information and I feel like we are living in a time where you can not even tell people how you feel about a product without it getting taken down from that company so they can continue to sell crap! Wake up shee-ople.

                terrible service  The tech that I talked to sounded like he was sitting at home, I could hear kids in the background. and he couldn't hear anything I was saying . He asked me for the serial number of my hp office jet he said it was on the bottom of my printer and I told him it wasn't there ,I finally discovered it after I had to pull the battery out . my hp printer wouldn't stop shutting down . and when I scan documents the scanner pulls multiple pages instead of one page at a time ,so I have to feed each page manually.I have had this printer ,scanner for only 2 months I do not recommend this product

                Orderd a monitor. It got cancelled pretty much straight away. I was using PayPal so they Auth the payment first and only take money once order its confirmed. But then they took the money said it would be with me by the 12th. Then cancelled it again. Told to wait 5 working days for money to be returned. Past 5 working days and still no refund. Criminals is the only word that comes to mind

                I purchased a desktop, and then found a much better deal from another site. Current shipment was still in ""processing"" stage, it had not even reached order assembly after 4 days (I had upgraded the RAM). I called to ask for a cancellation of the item and their response was that they cannot cancel any longer because they are supposedly already building the computer, and that I can only return it upon receiving it and pay a 15% restocking fee. As a grad student, 15% of a computer is a HUGE amount of money for me. Very disappointed, will definitely never purchase from HP again.

                I bought an HP Pavilion X360 literally just a year ago, and I sent extra money on the warranty. The warranty you would think would be a smart idea right? Well, it's not a good idea at all You wanna know why, right? That would be because they cover no accidental damages what so ever. This became a problem for me, after my computer started to stop working in just exactly one year. The want to charge me $700 to fix it. On e year old and I spend $1,00. I plan on never purchasing an HP laptop again.

                HP has horrible customer service, not to mention that they updated their firmware for a lot of printers and did not mention that if you update the firmware then you can't use refilled or after market cartridges and your printer won't work until you replace the cartridge with an OEM one. Of course their OEM ones are exorbitantly priced. Simple solution ditch HP and buy EPSON. Love that they have the refillable tanks and the ink lasts a long, long time unlike HP. Will never go back to HP. Also ditched their computers. Would not give them even 1 star but you can't write a review without choosing a star level.

                HP has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.   I need to get a business account registered so that I can submit laptops for repair and their stupid website keeps saying that there are duplicate contacts found for me and won't register my business account.  Anyways, I called customer service thinking, ""yeah they'll fix this, easy""... Boy was I wrong! I got passed to at least 5 different people that could not even understand English!! I finally got someone that seemed like they kind of knew what they were doing and then they hung up on me!!   I will never call HP support again. It's totally useless.

                Purchased the HP Deskjet 2630 All-In-One Printer 18 months ago for regular household use.  I was sceptical about the InstaInk option but found it easy to set up and now don't know how I'd manage without it.  The printer itself is wireless and the installation instructions are very easy to follow.  Even if you don't want InstaInk indefinitely, you may as well choose the InstaInk option initially and benefit from the 3-month free trial.  Go to 123.hp.com Follow the set up instructions for your printer.  On the recommendation of other purchasers, I chose the 300 page option for the free 3 month trial to get the maximum benefits from the free offer. (Edit: There's now an option for 500 free pages!!)  On the final page before subscription, there was a ""Special Offers (Optional)"" box in which I entered:  FREEINK for an additional 1 month free and lN7PW (the first letter is a lower case L) for an further 1 month free.  It didn't appear as if the codes had worked until I looked in the bottom right hand corner of the pop up window to see a list of the free months: 3 months free trial FREEINK 1 month free lN7PW 1 month free  Five free months of ink (1500 pages printed colour pages) and an excellent printer for less than two XL cartridges with my old HP printer.  Having used it for 18 months now and enjoyed the hassle-free delivery of cartridges ready for when I need them, I can highly recommend this printer and the InstantInk option.

                Most ripoff company I have EVER had the pain-FULL experience of having to deal with.You buy a printer for 100.00 sometimes less, then the ink last not even a month.  Ink cost $30.00 to $50.00.  So $50.00 per month to be able to print.  CRAP on HP Never will I EVER buy anything with HP name on it.  Ha! I tried to see what the cost of the ink is if I joined their club nope, not happening, sing up first, give them your credit card number, then and only then will you find out the cost, oh and of course you are in their 'club"" not for me!!!   I will use this printer with what ever ink I can find to work then I will buy a nice printer WITHOUT HP name on it!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!! No HP anything, bunch of RIP-OFFS

                We recently purchased from HP a business laptop on sale for $1300. It would always dim when the power cord was disconnected. I could not find where to stop this, and the screen was only 200 nits, so the dimming hurt my older eyes.  HP business support has very competent people––but their training is pretty bad.  Finally, a rep familiar with the problem simply downloaded the AMD graphics application which allowed this to be easily adjusted. Before that I went through 6 *long* phone calls, all of which were with agents who felt my system software was corrupted because the setting to adjust this was present in their older version of Windows 10 and not in mine. Turns out that is a known issue. Windows removed access to this setting in newer versions, but these guys did not know that.  They had me update to the very latest Windows, run a core level hardware test that took hours, and even re-image my computer.   Then they forced me to send the unit to their repair center, as the on-site repair support I purchased could not do any troubleshooting. I instructed them on the return repair sheet to carefully read all the case notes available to them.   The computer came back with the same problem, and their repair notes clearly showed that they never bothered to even look at the case notes. They just did the same thing I had already done and got the same results, not bothering to even acknowledge the problem they were supposed to fix.  But it gets much worse…….  We then purchased a printer that turned out to be defective. The quality of printer support is clearly much lower, but after over two hours the agent agreed to send us a replacement refurbished upgraded printer. It arrived and easily set up and worked. I sent the defective unit back as instructed within three business days, using the label supplied by HP.   Ten days later we get an email saying they have not received the printer and we will be charged for it if it is not shipped immediately. I kept the tracking number which provided proof of delivery a full three business days before the threatening email was sent.  I was unable to contact any type of support using the data for the replacement printer. Fortunately, we had the prior printer’s data, and after tons of wasted time, I get through to a support person who kept repeating that the printer had not been received after I told her five times that the UPS site provided proof of delivery to her warehouse. When I finally asked for a supervisor she apologized and said she would correct the problem and I could ignore the email. She also agreed to register the replacement printer, as that process would not work either.  The next day I confirmed that she simply fed me falsehoods to get rid of me. Another call to support resulted in a repeat of the prior call, with me giving details of the delivery and the agent saying it had not been received. Finally, he admitted that he had no way of checking the return tracking number for this case and that all he could do was send an email to the repair center with my complaint and supposedly including the tracking number I provided him.  This hardly left me feeling confident, so I posted about the problem on the HP forum. I was then contacted by a social media HP rep who emailed the complaint to the repair center. Late on the next business day, he told me the center acknowledged receiving the printer. Today, a day after that, we have still not received a confirmation from HP support.  I have left out other problems with HP support as this is already too long. But without the details, this condemnation would only be a subjective opinion.

                My experience of HP printing products after many years and several printers. I have worked all my life in IT technical service and support dealing directly with customers. These products from HP are designed to make the company as much money as possible without making it too obvious they are ripping people off. When a printer generates a error message the diagnostic tests should point clearly to where the fault is. Repeatedly telling customers to disconnect wait for 15 minutes and then reconnect to solve problems is not going to fix a underling problem. Ignoring customers stating they have already done this just frustrates them further. Here is a very common senario that is repeated in HP help steps and forum suggestions.......       ‎09-16-2016 06:35 PM  Product: HP Photosmart D5160 Operating System: Mac OS X 10.7 Lion This household has two HP printers -- a Photosmart D5160 and Officejet Pro 8610. Actually, my wife is now on her fourth HP printer -- the Officejet Pro -- because of problems with three previous HP printers that could not be resolved and had to be replaced.  Now, I'm having trouble my HP Photosmart D5160. In short, it won't print. I get numerous kinds of errors on the print utility, ranging from ""Cover is Open"" to ""Carriage is Stalled"" to ""Printer not Connected"", etc. All within minutes of one another. I do all the recommended trouble-shooting but nothing resolves the issue. When I contacted HP Support, I was told that my printer is no longer being serviced by HP. So, once again, this household is without one of its printers.  We do NOT use these printers that frequently. Maybe once or twice a week at most, so there is no 'wear &amp; tear' factor here. I'm not sure what to do. I'm ready to throw both of these printers into the garbage and go someplace else for a printer.

                Expensive products that become obsolete after a few short years so when you spend hundreds of dollars on them and the drivers stop properly installing customer support will tell you it's a hardware issue and you must upgrade- spend a few hundred more- on a newer product. Ink for printers are ridiculously priced and if you get the generic that is more reasonable priced they'll work a few times and then about halfway through the cartridges have an error message that is telling you there is a problem with your ink. Money hungry company that cares little about their consumers. Call support and they try to charge you twenty dollars for troubleshooting. Disgusting way of treating people. This is a perfect example of corporate america shitting the bed.

I asked to be transferred to a manager, so I could ask if there was anything the company can do even if it meant sponsoring me to a paid version for one month or even getting a discount, so I could afford this extremely expensive SPSS, and I got even ruder remarks and when I confronted the woman for being rude all I am asking for is help she hung up on me.

                IBM was the best business partner I ever had. I used IBM software to connect  my employees who worked from remote locations to my Architectural firms servers and to one another, We shared our work products and progress documentation with our clients their legal advisors, regulators having jurisdiction over the work and the contractors performing the construction throughout often fast tracked planning design and construction of public convention facilities .    We were a small firm, doing big projects. We got fortune 50 tools and service from IBM.  From the early days of OS2 to 2015 when I retired, IBM made my Architectural firms business plan possible and successful.  There is nobody better than IBM.

                My girlfriend made an online order for us. She drove out to the IKEA Taastrup where we ordered from and was told our order had been cancelled, recreated and cancelled again (I suspect a member of staff didn't fancy picking so many items) my partner asked how this was possible as the only information she had received was an order confirmation and instructions for us to go and collect our order.  She came home empty handed. After chatting to web chat she was instructed to call customer services. Customer services told her after a lengthy call that they had agreed for our order to be picked with the store and we could collect it after the next day. We have a newborn baby and were in the middle of moving so our time is limited and we were counting quite heavily on getting the curtains from our order to help put the baby down to sleep in the dark.  We also specifically chose online picking to avoid crowds (due to the virus) and to save time.  Next it was my turn. I drove again to IKEA early on Sunday morning to collect our order and made sure I arrived early enough (09:40) to be the 2nd car waiting outside the collection point.   IKEA staff came strolling out of the building around 10:15 and began dealing with the first car at least 20 mins after the supposed opening time. When it was my turn I was asked to wait in bay 1. I did so and after 10 minutes I was told very quickly through my car window that I needed to go to the returns section of the store to collect my order, and they had nothing to do with it (even though 10 minutes earlier they took the code customer services gave to my gf for our newly recreated order). At this point I was beginning to get very frustrated, it was weekend and the number of cars in the parking lot indicated there would be a lengthy queue.  The returns section was cordoned off due to the virus and I could see that only 1 or 2 people were being allowed down into the returns section at a time. I explained to the member of staff on the door my situation. This was the only member of staff of the 10 that I, or my partner dealt with who showed any real empathy to my story and situation. He let me go down, avoiding a queue that looked like it would take at least 45 minutes to get through.  Downstairs I spent 30-40 minutes with an angry, uninformative member of staff who made phone call after phone call. Always out of hearing distance for me and who told me multiple times ""it's busy""""you will have to pick your order yourself"" ""I don't know where your order is"". It was quite clear once I was asked to leave the collection point that my order had never been picked.  When you pay for a service you expect it to be delivered and if not at least a satisfactory answer to why what should be a standard business practice of order picking could go so wrong. If you're staff had any proper training then a simple apology, explanation of the error and some form of compensation would have kept me a happy customer. Instead her and others lack of empathy and desire to take responsibility to do this only fuelled my frustration more. I can see now that I am not the only one who has received such a shocking level of service so it is clear IKEAs promise to pick and deliver orders for such a low fee clearly backfired and fatigue set in for staff.  In the end I got a refund for the exact amount of our order, so I could go and pick my order myself and a measly 300 kr compensation for 2 wasted car trips and approx 8 hours of our time split over multiple days wasted not being able to collect the order as intended.  Terrible service execution and even worse service recovery.

                IKEA has a 10-year warranty on their couch products, and mine fell apart at the 2-year mark. Even with picture proof, they still insist on picking it up to verify the damage for themselves. In a normal world that fine, but during COVID they should make changes to their procedures to honor their own terms and conditions with the customer. They put the onus on the customer to keep the broken furniture until IKEA feels its okay to pick it up.   They don't really care about following their own rules; their customer service agents just makeup stuff and try to placate you with tiny discounts. Do you want your full refund? I hope your able to play the long game.

                Horrible experience using their ""design your wardrobe"" service.  - Had a useful 1st session where we designed the wardrobe. We agreed that we just needed to go home and decide on whether or not to add a drawer, and then we could pay from home that same day.  - Went home and tried to pay - turns out you NEED the IKEA employee to do this. Everything is ready to go, we just aren't allowed to buy. -  Call them up next day, wait in line for over 50 minutes (all the while being told it's almost your turn and they value your time...).  - Told that we have book another design your wardrobe meeting, you generally have to book well in advance to get one of these.  - In next meeting, we're told that you have to book with your local advisor, otherwise they cannot send you your wares. We have to book yet another meeting.  - We are now told they can't deliver for 12 days and some of the wares won't be available until 5 days from now. Unfortunately these won't be part of the order. Lots of confusion as to how many people we should be to receive the wares, since they apparently wont deliver into your apartment and which warehouses will have then missing pieces stocked at what time.  I strongly encourage everyone to pay a little extra, so you avoid spending weeks getting your actual wares, several trips to the physical store, and not the least - get nicer looking furniture.

                DO NOT ORDER FROM IKEA DURING THIS PANDEMIC! The order took one month to deliver, but only half arrived. No way to let them know of this within 48 hours, as they require, or any other time: phone customer service down day after day - it just hangs up on you saying they have a large volume of calls.  I totally agree with another reviewer: This is not  bad customer service - it's simply THEFT!

                Chatbot: How can I help you? Me: Selects option 'Damaged items' Chatbot: ok, no worries, come back to me when you're less busy.  What?! It's a pre-defined entry and it comes up with that response? Service number says the call centre is open 7 days a week, online says call centre is open 7 days a week. When you try and get in touch everything tells you it's closed (Saturday and Sunday within business hours).  I had ordered multiple new items for the kitchen, including glasses and crockery. It came in a massive box which was breaking apart, not marked fragile, which the delivery driver unknowingly dropped onto my porch. It was a miracle that there were only three broken mugs in it.   And now you are doing everything to avoid dealing with damages. I'm convinced I will have the same issue on Monday. I can't wait to deal with that bloody chatbot again... Pfft.

                Horrible website and user experience when ordering. The website narrow down all possible delivery options, giving you only the ones you can do with your current product, with no information about why other options are not available. I spent 1 week calling ant trying to figure out why i can't have my order delivered in express becaus i have to move soon and i want to get an idea about delivery times etc before ordering in due time. Now, once i figured out how their crappy system work, i can't order the items for the day i'm going to move to the new apartement, and i have to find where to stay for 2 days before i can furnish my place with the bare minimum.

                IKEA has a 10-year warranty on their couch products, and mine fell apart at the 2-year mark. Even with picture proof, they still insist on picking it up to verify the damage for themselves. In a normal world that fine, but during COVID they should make changes to their procedures to honor their own terms and conditions with the customer. They put the onus on the customer to keep the broken furniture until IKEA feels its okay to pick it up.   They don't really care about following their own rules; their customer service agents just makeup stuff and try to placate you with tiny discounts. Do you want your full refund? I hope your able to play the long game.

                Horrible experience using their ""design your wardrobe"" service.  - Had a useful 1st session where we designed the wardrobe. We agreed that we just needed to go home and decide on whether or not to add a drawer, and then we could pay from home that same day.  - Went home and tried to pay - turns out you NEED the IKEA employee to do this. Everything is ready to go, we just aren't allowed to buy. -  Call them up next day, wait in line for over 50 minutes (all the while being told it's almost your turn and they value your time...).  - Told that we have book another design your wardrobe meeting, you generally have to book well in advance to get one of these.  - In next meeting, we're told that you have to book with your local advisor, otherwise they cannot send you your wares. We have to book yet another meeting.  - We are now told they can't deliver for 12 days and some of the wares won't be available until 5 days from now. Unfortunately these won't be part of the order. Lots of confusion as to how many people we should be to receive the wares, since they apparently wont deliver into your apartment and which warehouses will have then missing pieces stocked at what time.  I strongly encourage everyone to pay a little extra, so you avoid spending weeks getting your actual wares, several trips to the physical store, and not the least - get nicer looking furniture.

                DO NOT ORDER FROM IKEA DURING THIS PANDEMIC! The order took one month to deliver, but only half arrived. No way to let them know of this within 48 hours, as they require, or any other time: phone customer service down day after day - it just hangs up on you saying they have a large volume of calls.  I totally agree with another reviewer: This is not  bad customer service - it's simply THEFT!

                Chatbot: How can I help you? Me: Selects option 'Damaged items' Chatbot: ok, no worries, come back to me when you're less busy.  What?! It's a pre-defined entry and it comes up with that response? Service number says the call centre is open 7 days a week, online says call centre is open 7 days a week. When you try and get in touch everything tells you it's closed (Saturday and Sunday within business hours).  I had ordered multiple new items for the kitchen, including glasses and crockery. It came in a massive box which was breaking apart, not marked fragile, which the delivery driver unknowingly dropped onto my porch. It was a miracle that there were only three broken mugs in it.   And now you are doing everything to avoid dealing with damages. I'm convinced I will have the same issue on Monday. I can't wait to deal with that bloody chatbot again... Pfft.

Lots of important items like bed and mattress were not delivered, We had to just run to an open store on the other side of the city to get an air mattress to don't sleep on the floor! Unbelievably irresponsible!   More than half value of the order didn't delivered! This is not a bad service or anything like that, it's simply THEFT!

We ordered a PAX wardrobe , had an amazing online consultation with someone and then it only took a week to arrive after we had placed the order.

                Simply TERRIBLE.  Ordered the things.. Delivery firm left without giving me a 20kg packet. Ikea want to send it by post 2 months later. Refused to send missing item by delivery firm or return cost. A bad situation made worse by bad service.  Not impressed. 1 star is lowest I can find.

                Don't place an online order with IKEA. They messed up my order, and there is no way to contact support by phone or email - you have to wait 20+ minutes for an 'online chat'. I had to do this several times just to cancel my order. Go into store or, better still, order from a online retailer prepared to invest in after-sales customer service.

                Horrible website and user experience when ordering. The website narrow down all possible delivery options, giving you only the ones you can do with your current product, with no information about why other options are not available. I spent 1 week calling ant trying to figure out why i can't have my order delivered in express becaus i have to move soon and i want to get an idea about delivery times etc before ordering in due time. Now, once i figured out how their crappy system work, i can't order the items for the day i'm going to move to the new apartement, and i have to find where to stay for 2 days before i can furnish my place with the bare minimum.

                This is all pre-covid lockdown, starting in 2018.   Long story short, I bought a mattress in 2015 with 25 year warranty, and when the bed started falling apart during regular use, they will not respond to my request for warranty claim. I have tried since 2018 and in 2020 had to just get a new mattress from someone else. I have proof that some of my attempts to contact them through the channel they recommended (using the online contact form) did reach them, as I have the ""No reply"" confirmation email telling me that they will get back to me. They never ever did get back to me. Their tactic with warranty claims seems to be to ignore until the customer goes away. I find it disgusting that they would bait customers with long warranties (25 years is the longest I've heard of for mattresses) and then just completely ignore their warranty duties. Anyone else having this issue with IKEA? If there are enough of us suffering this, perhaps we can get a class action suit against IKEA.

                Our bad experience with Ikea started pre coronavirus when they sent us the wrong item we had ordered online. We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures.   When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store.   So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item.   This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.  After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get.   Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money.   I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one. Little more than thieves!

After waiting 30 minutes I ended the chat and waited back in the queue for 20 minutes to talk to another analyst. This analyst cancelled my order without my permission and I received an email with a credit invoice that I will now not get for 10+ working days. I am livid. I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless.

                Don't do IKEA. Do anything else other than IKEA, just make sure it's not IKEA. Their Online platform has been absolutely horrendous and this was the case even before the pandemic.  My wife and I have been trying to order over 6K in Kitchen cabinets, but their service malfunctioned every time. We tried calling for over 2 weeks to get this sorted out and were told the only thing we can do is to start from scratch.. We did this, but every time we submitted our order the system would say 'This item is not available'. We deleted the item and tried again, BUT another item is now no longer available. I stubbornly continued until there was literally NOTHING available. Tried calling, but that doesn't do anything. Tried emailing, but you can't.. This story could and should be much MUUUCH longer, but to keep it short- DON'T SHOP HERE!.. I'm also a contractor with 3 kitchen and 2 bath remodels scheduled for the summer and we will definitely not be going with IKEA. And because I'm so unbelievably annoyed (and stubborn) with his company, I'll be sure to inform all my friends to do the same... This is now my life mission.

                LONG STORY SHORT:  IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam.   DETAILS: This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks.  So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available.  I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either.  In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one.  Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour.  I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful.  Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy? At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.

                I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job.   I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.  On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.

                I made an order on the site on the 16th of March, the delivery was scheduled for the 24th of March.  They called me on the 21st of March to say that a part of the delivery will arrive on the 7th of April. Another part arrived on the 2nd of April instead of the 24th of March and there wasn't one of two pillows there. I filled the form on their site to report the missed position on the same day but since then nobody has contacted me. COVID-19 is a good cover for bad service, right guys?

                If I could give zero stars I would. I placed an order for a loft bed and mattress almost a month ago. On the first of delivery attempt the drivers gave me one box out of the three items that I ordered. Two boxes that belong to an us another customer and was told that I was supposed to get three boxes here is three boxes if they’re not correct we can’t take them back you have to call customer service. That was three weeks ago I have had another customers order sitting in my house for three weeks my daughter who is five years old has been without a bed for three weeks waiting on this to be delivered. I am now being told that to the mattress that I had ordered and paid for is now out of stock which it wasn’t when I ordered it. The delivery company keeps trying to deliver the frame itself or to pick up the other customers order no attempts to get my order correct have been made. IKEAs customer service has been incredibly awful to say the least. They seem to be more prone to just throw money at the situation instead of trying to fix it. I don’t need money thrown out the situation I need my order I’m at the point where I’m going to just cancel my order in order with somebody else. If you have the option to order with anybody other than IKEA do it worst experience ever will not be shopping with them again

                Cannot give less than one star but would if I could. Ikea took my money but my items have not been delivered despite assurances they would be. Now the webchat told me the system is down and they cannot even check to see what is happening. I notice multiple other customers in Ireland are having the same problem. This is indefensible. The least they can do is to communicate by email.  I see ikea is giving away free furniture to needy families. Doing one publicity stunt is not going to make up for neglecting paying customers.

                IKEA Ireland After asking why my order is 1 week late, they told me it cannot be reeboked so it needs to be cancelled. Refund will take 14 days.  So no product delivered and they keep the money for 5 weeks in total.   Luckily I only bought cheap stuff to keep me going during renovation. Wouldn't buy Ikea products to keep long term as majority looks as if it's made of paper.

                This review is for Ikea Ireland.  Ikea took the money on the day order was placed and never delivered goods after waiting 2 weeks for delivery I have received email and text that goods will be delivered but on the day of delivery nothing happened. , no goods arrived. . Support hung up in the middle of conversation and support manager not responding to follow up email. They said there is nothing they can do and to wait another 2 weeks for delivery. Offered no alternative or compensation. Probably the worst shopping experience I have ever had.  Another week goes by, support not responding on follow up email. No communication. Then out of nowhere, I get a text that my order is cancelled. Lovely. Great job Ikea, you must be proud of yourself

                (Reviewing Ikea UK) Chaotic online experience. Order placed several weeks ago with a long delivery lead time. A week before delivery was due I received a cancellation email without any further information. Customer services advised the product was out of stock and couldn't be delivered. A couple of days later it arrived. Fortunately I hadn't got round to ordering from elsewhere.

                Order was to be delivered 24.4.20, I ordered the item 31.3.20. There was nothing on site to say how ling orders would be delayed due to covid, still nothing! Judging by the reviews on this site it would appear that order has been cancelled.  I will not use this company again. Simple.

                This is all pre-covid lockdown, starting in 2018.   Long story short, I bought a mattress in 2015 with 25 year warranty, and when the bed started falling apart during regular use, they will not respond to my request for warranty claim. I have tried since 2018 and in 2020 had to just get a new mattress from someone else. I have proof that some of my attempts to contact them through the channel they recommended (using the online contact form) did reach them, as I have the ""No reply"" confirmation email telling me that they will get back to me. They never ever did get back to me. Their tactic with warranty claims seems to be to ignore until the customer goes away. I find it disgusting that they would bait customers with long warranties (25 years is the longest I've heard of for mattresses) and then just completely ignore their warranty duties. Anyone else having this issue with IKEA? If there are enough of us suffering this, perhaps we can get a class action suit against IKEA.

                Our bad experience with Ikea started pre coronavirus when they sent us the wrong item we had ordered online. We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures.   When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store.   So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item.   This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.  After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get.   Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money.   I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one. Little more than thieves!

After waiting 30 minutes I ended the chat and waited back in the queue for 20 minutes to talk to another analyst. This analyst cancelled my order without my permission and I received an email with a credit invoice that I will now not get for 10+ working days. I am livid. I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless. Very similar experience as the review below! Will never buy from here again, worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.

                Don't do IKEA. Do anything else other than IKEA, just make sure it's not IKEA. Their Online platform has been absolutely horrendous and this was the case even before the pandemic.  My wife and I have been trying to order over 6K in Kitchen cabinets, but their service malfunctioned every time. We tried calling for over 2 weeks to get this sorted out and were told the only thing we can do is to start from scratch.. We did this, but every time we submitted our order the system would say 'This item is not available'. We deleted the item and tried again, BUT another item is now no longer available. I stubbornly continued until there was literally NOTHING available. Tried calling, but that doesn't do anything. Tried emailing, but you can't.. This story could and should be much MUUUCH longer, but to keep it short- DON'T SHOP HERE!.. I'm also a contractor with 3 kitchen and 2 bath remodels scheduled for the summer and we will definitely not be going with IKEA. And because I'm so unbelievably annoyed (and stubborn) with his company, I'll be sure to inform all my friends to do the same... This is now my life mission.

Ikea,Furniture,1 star: Bad,"
                LONG STORY SHORT:  IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam.   DETAILS: This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks.  So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available.  I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either.  In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one.  Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour.  I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful.  Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy? At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.

                I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job.   I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.  On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.  I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies.

                Cannot give less than one star but would if I could. Ikea took my money but my items have not been delivered despite assurances they would be. Now the webchat told me the system is down and they cannot even check to see what is happening. I notice multiple other customers in Ireland are having the same problem. This is indefensible. The least they can do is to communicate by email.  I see ikea is giving away free furniture to needy families. Doing one publicity stunt is not going to make up for neglecting paying customers.

                IKEA Ireland After asking why my order is 1 week late, they told me it cannot be reeboked so it needs to be cancelled. Refund will take 14 days.  So no product delivered and they keep the money for 5 weeks in total.   Luckily I only bought cheap stuff to keep me going during renovation. Wouldn't buy Ikea products to keep long term as majority looks as if it's made of paper.

                Ikea Norway (Forus): Poor and missing information regarding online Click and collect-order. - Wrong and confusing online store and warehouse stock status when ordering online.  - Techincal issues with ordering online, especially regarding shipping/packing/delivery. - No information when goods where packed and ready to collect (Click and collect).  - No update on order status.  - No help from chatbot. - Long wait, poor and rushed help from customer care.

                This review is for Ikea Ireland.  Ikea took the money on the day order was placed and never delivered goods after waiting 2 weeks for delivery I have received email and text that goods will be delivered but on the day of delivery nothing happened. , no goods arrived. . Support hung up in the middle of conversation and support manager not responding to follow up email. They said there is nothing they can do and to wait another 2 weeks for delivery. Offered no alternative or compensation. Probably the worst shopping experience I have ever had.  Another week goes by, support not responding on follow up email. No communication. Then out of nowhere, I get a text that my order is cancelled. Lovely. Great job Ikea, you must be proud of yourself

                (Reviewing Ikea UK) Chaotic online experience. Order placed several weeks ago with a long delivery lead time. A week before delivery was due I received a cancellation email without any further information. Customer services advised the product was out of stock and couldn't be delivered. A couple of days later it arrived. Fortunately I hadn't got round to ordering from elsewhere.

                They don't deserve one star.  I placed an online order after stay home order. My credit card was charged same day. I received one order confirmation email. On the day of delivery, my husband and I moved the furniture around to make room for three chests that we ordered. No calls and no emails and no delivery. Not next day or the day after.  There was email option only for IKEA business customer so I called IKEA customer service, only to be told ""there are usual number of calls and we cannot take your call"" and a hang up x four consecutive days.  I finally managed to find a page to request refund. I gave them reason for seeking refund and submitted this form. No confirmation of receipt of this request.  What kind of business are they running? Do they not care about their customers? Their reputation? Are they so well off they don't need business from little guys?  If there's no one working, how about telling us that they plan to halt operation so we don't waste an entire week waiting for that doorbell?  It really doesn't take that much effort.

                So disappointed with their COVID-19 delivery service response. I placed an online order 17 days ago. The day I placed my order I received a message saying my order was being handpicked. Then nothing..... When I contacted Ikea today 17 days later, all I get is 'sorry, fed-ex is behind'. I can understand that, but what I do not comprehend is how I can be told Ikea has no idea when it will be delivered. April, May, June? My order is still with the store. Ikea's shipping fees are some of the highest in the industry, yet there is no accountability for giving me any information as to an estimated delivery date on their part. Ikea you need to negotiate a better delivery contract. You need to lower your delivery fees, especially in an age when Amazon does much faster and for free. You need to up your game if you wish to stay in the long run. And, you need to better equip your employees with information so that they can communicate effectively with the customer.

                It is not okay, that you, in this difficult situation, sees a potential and only the good business case in making a lot of extra money by charging a pick up fee of €9,99. We as customers can't choose the alternative that you probably prefer - going to your stores and making a lot of impulse purchases. The only alternative is to get it delivered, but the delivery of even PostNl packages is estimated to take 2 weeks.  What makes it even worse, is that your colleagues in Denmark (where i'm from) have removed this fee. It is hence free of charge to pick up orders in your Danish stores. Does the right hand not know what the left is doing, or is this just a classic Dutch way of making the most of every given situation to make a few more pennies?

                I ordered 15 storage boxes and lids which were delivered on the correct day within the allocated time slot. However 3 of the boxes were broken due to extremely poor packaging.  Under normal circumstances I would return all the items and ask for a refund, however as I needed the boxes urgently for a house move, I couldn't return them.  I used the 12 goods ones, but this is clearly unacceptable.

                I have never had a bad enough experience that I've had to share with my entire circle of family and friends just how bad a company can be and to avoid them.    I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.  First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.  I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes.  I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.  The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story.   I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.   I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.   How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.  I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad. They offered me free shipping HAHAHA. Goodbye IKEA. Hello Wayfair....

                Their deliveries are always late and their customer service number has you pushing numbers then they say too many calls ahead of you and cannot take your call then hangs up. they charged me $221 twice and it never got delivered. I've been on hold now for 18 minutes. that's only after I pushed the number to ORDER, instead of inquiring. bullsh*t. I will never order from them again. she was supposed to just check on the status of my order that's 10 days late and she never comes back on the line.

                I ordered 15 storage boxes and lids which were delivered on the correct day within the allocated time slot. However 3 of the boxes were broken due to extremely poor packaging.  Under normal circumstances I would return all the items and ask for a refund, however as I needed the boxes urgently for a house move, I couldn't return them.  I used the 12 goods ones, but this is clearly unacceptable.

                I have never had a bad enough experience that I've had to share with my entire circle of family and friends just how bad a company can be and to avoid them.    I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.  First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.  I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes.  I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.  The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story.   I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.   I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.   How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.  I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad. They offered me free shipping HAHAHA. Goodbye IKEA. Hello Wayfair....

                Their deliveries are always late and their customer service number has you pushing numbers then they say too many calls ahead of you and cannot take your call then hangs up. they charged me $221 twice and it never got delivered. I've been on hold now for 18 minutes. that's only after I pushed the number to ORDER, instead of inquiring. bullsh*t. I will never order from them again. she was supposed to just check on the status of my order that's 10 days late and she never comes back on the line.

                Contact is zero. All apparent contacts including online cancellation facility lead to dead ends. It is not ok to hide behind Corona for this. You cannot chose to facilitate only the part of the service that benefits you - ordering and paying was very easy - then blank anything outside of this. Dreadful.

                Good price for products, but seems like they have lowered product quality over the last many years. We ordered a lot from them recently, and the combination of wrongly delivered order, bad quality of shelf-system component, part that need to be returned, and a horrible customer service experience yesterday, I cannot justify giving higher than 1 star

                With the news about the furniture lawsuit in the papers about faulty dressers, it may be helpful to revive Ikea's value. Mistakes happen, and its how a company reacts to make the change.  -- Ikea is focusing on the value its products bring to their consumers, not with just an affordable pricing structure. They've precisely pinpointed their cost structure in the sweet-spots of wallets. And to supplement that pricing, they give consumers a community to belong to with their open floorplans and a unique buying experience. It almost gives me a vision as to what a success story looks like, with seeing open housing concepts and being able to capture my own independence when I buy a home or condo, and begin to liven it up; just by walking around. Ikea supplies just that right amount of ""gunpowder"" to make an idea explode into action. Cheap, but not discount store quality. What other furnishing company can pull that off?

                Ikea Taufkirchen (München Deutschland)  If it is possible to give even lower score, I'd gladly give it. Today I was waiting for 3,5 hours (I came at 9:50AM and went out from IKEA at 3PM)  just to change 2 small things on already pre-designed kitchen. They keep you waiting for more then 3 hours due to their complete incompetence as how they say: they have no personnel who speaks English.., so instead of informing people like me about that, they keep letting other people to design their own kitchen while (English speakers, wait in the IKEA like morons). More disturbing part was, that I was speaking with them in English and they have replied without any problem. While people were waiting to be served, personnel were having fun, fooling around,  laughing, joking and acting totally unprofessional and inadequate. On top of that, when you request to speak with whoever is in charge at that department, some of their personnel are completely dishonest saying that they mentioned that this takes more then two hours, while to me they claimed it is ""up to 2 hours"" (huge difference)... To IKEA folk: Do you really think that wasting 3.5 hours of customers time is a normal thing..., shifting our plans and agendas, while in parallel you don't even consider that it is important to inform people prior,t  you have issues with your own personnel/man power, and/or that you cannot serve English speaking folk?

                IKEA Manchester overcharged us by £21.00. I only discovered this once we got home. I called customer service and was told we'd have to return to the store within 14 days to get a refund and that they'd have to check the CCTV. This was not welcome news as it meant a 1-hour round trip on a work evening which was highly inconvenient. I couldn't believe that they didn't have a better and more sophisticated system in place than looking on CCTV. Despite the frustration, we turned up to the store yesterday evening only to be told that they didn't gave any staff available to check the CCTV so couldn't issue a refund! I was furious and demanded to see the manager. The manager was devoid of any charm or pleasantness and told me it was their policy to check cctv first and that I wouldn't get a refund until the next day. We were given a case number and told we woukd receive a call once the refund was done. I made my frustration known and said I intended to complain. The manager looked totally unconcerned, and reading comments here I can see why. They basically couldn't care less because no one's going to do anything or take any action. I checked their website for their complaints procedure and there isn't even a complaints category included as far as I could see. Again, another clear signal of just how little they care about their customers. After searching via Google I found an email address for Javier Quinones at IKEA and emailed about my situation. Not even an automated response came back telling me how long before I'd receive a reply. By 2.40 pm today, no one had called back so I contacted customer service again. After almost 40 minutes on the phone of stalling and being put on hold for ages several times, I put my foot down and finally got to speak to the manager. I was told he'd contact the store to get them to resolve it but there were all sorts of excuses given for their useless response. I told him I expected the refund to be sorted within the next hour as it was their error and I'd spent so long trying to get this resolved. I tweeted about their useless service on IKEA Support and got a quick public response asking me to DM them. I did this but they did nothing in response except give me another pointless reason for why they couldn't sort it out. So, merely a face-saving exercise in public, which is sheer hypocrisy. We are still awaiting the refund so the only route for us now is via our credit card company. I see that IKEA don't bother to respond to any of the many complaints on here which again just shows their contempt for their customers. With all their millions of profit, they still refuse to give us our £21 back that they took in error. It beggars belief. Truly, I never want to deal with this vile organisation again. It's a toxic company staffed by management who couldn't care less. Avoid at all costs if you want to keep your sanity and money.

Ikea completely ignores problem - been trying to get them to address the issue for 8 weeks and they keep closing out the case and wont provide a written response as to why they wont address it.

At IKEA, you better read the small letters cuz they will happily make you believe that you pay cheaper than you actually will. Asked the guy at the counter, he said because we didn't buy it for IKEA family card. Congrats IKEA, you gained 50kr and you lost a customer for life.

I called ikea support, and they said that apparently nobody will come to deliver the items unless you answer a call from an unknown number a couple hours beforehand. I never answer calls from unknown numbers. It should be illegal to charge people for services you did not provide. I will not be paying for redelivery, and ikea is refusing to refund the $50 I already paid for delivery. Unfortunately, I paid with a debit card, so there is no way to dispute the transaction.

                The product I purchased and received was fair for the price. However....due to horrible prep of the product for shipping one of the plates I ordered was broken. I’ve sent 2 emails and the only reply I get from IKEA is I’ve not given enough information. I even sent pictures of the pss poor packaging and the broken plate and they still refused to replace this $4 plate!! I’ve given the order number, the item number and every other number I could find. We are talking about a $4 plate. Customer Service with this company is nonexistent from my experience. Would have given a -⭐️ if offered. Yes customer service is just that important!

                I have two rooms full of Ikea products and so far I am pleased with them. Indeed they are pricey sometimes, but you can wait for the sales or at least choose only small furniture like desks, tables, beds etc. if you don’t want to pay too much. You have to be careful with the furniture as it can easily get scratched and of course because it’s made of wood splinters you can’t expect it to last for 10 years. But who knows if you take really good care of it, maybe you’ll be surprised. So far I am happy with my products and I didn’t have any bad experiences with them. I usually go there and buy them myself, but when I bought the bed, mattress and wardrobe I had to choose for them to be delivered. The guys were really nice and the furniture was in perfect condition. (I also have mirrors on the wardrobe and they came intact)

                the standard breakfast they offered till recently has changed to an obligatory unhealthy one.  Instead of the previously offered standard breakfast that included, omelet, mushrooms, potato-croquettes, baked tomato and bread,  they removed the tomato, the mushrooms and the potato-croquettes and they added mandatory (or you pay but don't get them) the bacon and Frankfurt sausages.   Nothing juicy any longer (the only juicy element was the removed tomato). So the bread becomes also inedible. What an idea !!!   So if you remember the breakfast they offered at the Athens Airport IKEA store, just forget it ! (unless you are addicted to unhealthy breakfast).

                We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery.  On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was ""dented"" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.) The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours. The agent told us they were low on stock and would have to call us back on Wednesday (which is a week later).  That call never came either, and on Thursday we called IKEA again, got put on hold for hours, only to be told by the agent that our case needs to be transferred to the after-sales department, which is unavailable currently due to ""high call volumes"".  We called once again on Friday, got put on hold again, got told by an agent again that he'd need to transfer us to the after-sales department, to which by the way there's no direct line, so you have to remain connected through two transfers and two queues or else your enquiries won't even reach a human being. So after waiting another several hours and 29 other callers ahead of us, we got hold of an agent who, to add insult to injury, tried to offer us 20% discount to keep the broken wardrobe. When we told him no, he said he'd put through a replacement delivery scheduled next Sunday for 1-5pm. Sunday 5pm passed as well, and on our final call to IKEA we were told the replacement order was never even processed by the system. The after-sales agent implied it took two days to process an order in their esoteric system, and they didn't even offer a way to notify us in the event of an order-processing failure, or somehow guarantee a delivery after everything. We're left to wait another few days with now little confidence the delivery will ever actually arrive. At this point I'm at a loss for words.

                I am trying to make a return and it is virtually impossible. Filled out the form on their website 8 times and they emailed me back asking if I want to pay for pickup. I emailed back (per instructions on the email) that YES I wanted a pick up, and I told them the address, and no response. I did this process so many times. Then I called customer service (which I could not reach anyone for two weeks because the lines were busy apparently every single time I called) and they said they would send me a return label, and guess what, they never did :).   As far as I am concerned, there is no other way to take care of this return via internet. Which is completely ridiculous.

                I spent £4920 on a new IKEA kitchen. I had my builder take out my old kitchen and then booked him to install the IKEA kitchen based on their promised delivery date. But IKEA repeatedly rescheduled my kitchen delivery, each time only telling me so on the day itself. This delay cost the builder three days of lost work, for which he invoiced me £600. I told IKEA this and they invited me to send them his invoice indicating that they do offer reimbursements. But while they accepted the legitimacy of the builder's company, his tax status, and of the claim, they refused to pay the invoice on the grounds that his company is not VAT registered - a factor which is of course irrelevant to the claim. It is of course perfectly legitimate for a company not to be VAT registered, but IKEA tell me it is against their own regulations. So I am left with a bill for £600 from my builder for lost time through no fault of my own, which IKEA refuses to refund on a technicality of their own invention (nothing to do with UK consumer law) which I cannot get around.

                So IKEA has this 365 days return right? complete scam... this is just to attract customers to their shop and screw them up later. I purchased a the Vemile sofa from Ikea, 4 seater. After about 150 days, when i was returning it since it was very uncomfortable and for its extremely low/bad quality,  i called the customer service and asked if i can return back the sofa, stating that I used it for 150 days, I don't have the original package since the return was not planned, and that if i can get refund to the original method of payment, my CC they said yes. so i rented a truck and disassembled the sofa, and took it there to be faced with these scammers. IKEA customer service kept me holding and arguing with them for 4 hours 6:00pm till 10:00pm and be faced with these scammers on the counter that didn't want to return the sofa. why? because they said its used and i don't have the original packaging stating that they only take it if it is with the packaging to ""PUT BACK ON SHELF &amp; SELL IT TO OTHER PEOLE"". Customer service on the phone says something which is not inline with the store customer service. IKEA staff has misunderstanding between them, this shouldn't be reflected on the customers.  3 issues here:  1. customer service on the phone says one thing, Customer service in store says another and argue with you and their manager just disappears for not wanting to Meet the customer, which she was employed to deal with.  2. IKEA wants to put the furniture back on the shelf?? really?? then did i buy a used sofa before and paid the full price of it? are they selling used furniture with the price of a new one?  3. 365 days return policy!! hahahahahahahha tell this to someone that has no common sense. there will always be something that you will pull off not to return.  If anyone has a sense of mind, don't go to IKEA to buy anything. they will only make you lose your money and its value.

                Worst customer service experience from IKEA in Edinburgh. I bought a PAX wardrobe built to the instructions but it all fell apart. The back board wasn’t much stronger than cardboard and the rest was very poor quality.  When i phoned I got a very rude customer service manager who basically told us we had built it wrong. Not sure how she could know that with no evidence at all. I then spoke to someone else over email who looked at pictures and said we had built it wrong. He said this is a very common problem with this wardrobe and therefore he knew we had built it wrong. Problem: if this is a regular problem perhaps maybe there is an issue with this wardrobe?? however they refuse to give us a refund! I will never buy another thing from IKEA. I am absolutely disgusted! My problem with this is that IKEA are a massive corporation and I am me! Customers should not feel like this. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.

                I ordered furniture for +8000 SEK for my house in Sweden from Ikea.se. The order was scheduled for delivery today. Nobody called me about the delivery and hours later I got an email saying the delivery could not be done and to call customer service.  From customer service I learned that - according to IKEA - the delivery driver had tried to call me once and I had not picked up. And they cancelled the delivery. If want a new delivery, I had to pay for deliver again.   First of all, I did not receive this call, despite the fact that Ikea confirmed that my number was correct. I was literally waiting for the phone to call and I can see in my call history that NO ONE tried to call me.  And now the very rude customer service representative requires me to pay again. I told her that wasn't fair since I didn't get the phone call and everything was ready for delivery. She finally told me that I wouldn't get delivery without paying for it again. And hung up on me without rescheduling another delivery, thus effectively hijacking my paid for furniture until I pay up.   Now I have the option to either 1) NOT get the furniture I've already paid for, or 2) pay double fee for delivery, without any guarantee that I'll actually get my furniture - because, as I learned from the customer representative, if the driver can't reach me again, they'll also cancel the second delivery. And so on.   I'm very surprised anyone choses to run a business this way in this day and age. The customer representative thought she was very generous and said Ikea could perhaps pay half the delivery fee, but it's not about the money, it's about what's right and fair. And so far, I've already paid 8000 SEK for nothing.

Found a lot of products that interested me however not all products available in this store wS disappointed by this. For the size of this store coukd have done better in that note. Love the meatballs at the restaurant like the fact you don't get greedy on portion size too. Plenty on offer fir food tables kept in clean condition too plenty of seating lots fir price. Found you competitive a cross the store on prices lots of different products to choose from I bought lighting tdy with copper bulbs. Like things that are different fir my home without the huge whack of a price tag for being different. Plenty of parking for all including disabled users and guide dogs have plenty of avenues to chose from the place is massive. There are shortcuts aswel in the building if you look out for them. Clean well presented on everything is put to view and feel so you know what you getting before buying. The road going in is a bit annoying they expect you to drive all way around to fall into the stingy lane fir access to car parking this is annoying.  Que at till took a while to shorten so patience here if you count to ten or you would probably just leave after getting fed up of the wait. Found staff at tills polite. It's a good store just few niggles or I would have given an extra star. Plenty to choose from minute you enter to when you leave.  I liked my trip I just hope you don't discontinue things as quickly on ranges.  Felt kitchens were if better quality tdy on viewing than what they used to be and very competitive fir price. Good store good parking lots of access for all and friendly service just wee issues to improve. We'll done though your doing a good job I felt valued tdy before parting with my reddies.

Then I hike down the 'pull area' the literally last slot only to find a sign that read ""no longer available"" what??? NO ONE could be bothered to put that sign on at least ONE of the SEVERAL displays?? the item is still listed as 'avaiable' on the store website.

                Awful experience that has put me off buying anything else from IKEA for life. I ordered a sofa and phoned to check whether the delivery service would bring it into my flat and the room of my choice. I was reassured by the IKEA representative that they would climb the external staircase to my flat, so I paid extra for the delivery service. The delivery men refused to carry it up the stairs to my flat (even with my help). After a fuss, they left all 7 boxes outside at the bottom and disappeared. I was left to carry all the boxes up the stairs on my own (including the heavy big boxes weighing 42kgs). After two hours managed to somehow lift it to the top. Once in, I was putting my sofa together and found 4 sofa legs were missing from the pack. I reported it to customer service, who said they would send it in 7-10 days. So now I have to wait another week and a half until I can fix it and sit on my sofa properly.

                I must admit the delivery came on time and all my order was delivered and there was no issues with what I received, however due to being disabled and recently moving in to an apartment I asked the delivery men to put the boxes in the empty bedroom. One of them did not wipe his feet and it resulted in  damage being done to my carpet, he was apologetic and suggested to me to complain to get the carpet cleaned. However when I did complain to Transport services complaints their answer was that there was no damage to the items they delivered so basically who cares that we muddied your carpet. Therefore I would be weary of the delivery services they employ and also I think that the complaints dept is redundant as I complained and nothing was done. I will never use IKEA delivery again thanks to a lack of customer service and the cost of having carpets cleaned.

                Warning - if you are using the £20 Xmas tree voucher use it for one item only if you are buying more than one item as the discount gets pro rata’d - therefore even if you’ve Spent well over £20 and you have to return an item, you won’t be refunded full amount !  I spent £127 and had to return £30 Kingsize bed slats I purchased for an ikea kingsize bed, because they didn’t fit (hasten to add it’s the second set I’ve purchased as the current set, also bought from ikea, don’t fit and fall off every night).  I only got £25.28 back ! So not only have I still spent £97 - I’ve only received £16.72 discount from the promised £20 and still don’t have a bed fit for purpose ~ spoke to customer service and they didn’t really care or offer compensation ~ just suggested I waste a bit more petrol by returning to the store and buying another set 20 cm wider that probably won’t fit and will then also need to be returned and a bit more petrol wasted. I had wanted to return a very expensive cutlery tray (£27) as it has chipped 1st time cutlery was put in it (the wooden looking ones - don’t buy!) but if I do that, once again I won’t get full refund - I’ll lose another £4.25 !  I also have Pax wardrobes drawers - they have faded in different shades so now look striped - another item you shouldn’t purchase is the large hemnes drawers as there is no support underneath and unit bows in middle.  Why do I still go there??  My kid loves the meatballs !

                Horrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!!  I am at a loss at what to do. I bought a faulty kitchen (worktop). It's badly or not at all treated and already has water damage, the cover strip is coming off due to it and it's constantly damp as it absorbs all the water.   As the solid wood worktop has 25 years warranty I contacted Ikea to have a recplacement worktop or refund.  They informed a third party technician needs to come by for an inspection. And there is no other way. This inspector only comes one a month to Ireland  and I was expected to wait a month. Which I finally had To accept. When I called to confirm this, the technician wasn't available anymore and they don't have a replacement available nor an idea of when they come by.  I thought surely Ikea would sort something out, but Nothing! I keep Being referred to their policy And expected to wait!!!  I actually don't know what to do as the damage is getting worse everyday, my kitchen is looking horrible and no idea if/ when someone might help.   Don't buy a kitchen here!!!!!

                Very disappointed with the customer service. A price tag on a display item showed a discount. I assumed this discount applies to this product, but was wrong. It appeared that the discounted was only this one particular item. When I spoke with a customer service person in store, I learned that I should have ""looked at other same products to confirm the discount"" and ""asked a stuff member to give me this item from display, so I could use the discount"". What an utter nonsense?? Lesson: be careful, when you see a discounted product, make sure the discount indeed applies; otherwise you may find yourself as surprised as I did.

                The worst. The Store and XPO delivery truck are either liars, have zero communication skills or a combination of both. Took 2 business days off to receive an order that apparently was never ready for delivery on IKEA/deliveries end and decided not to advise THE CUSTOMER. How are they going to off-set my lost time/money for this disgraced service. If it wasn't for the dirt cheap furniture, you're better off investing in better furniture elsewhere and receiving proper customer/delivery service. Would even rate less than 1 star if possible. Just got thru to IKEA and ""the extent of compensation"" for this is a $50 gift card.

                With my first order, everything went well. Delivery in time, good quality items for a good price. So I ordered something else. Shouldn't have done that... I paid over £100, delivery was promised for last Sunday. No delivery, just a message from the delivery company about a delay, with an update promised within 24 hours. No update. I raised an issue, the delivery company promised an investigation, since the parcel had kind of disappeared, result due within 3-5 working days, communicated to the sender, not me. But I was at least promised an 'initial update' within 24 hours. Then I contacted Ikea. They told me I just had to wait. I wanted to cancel the order, but was told this wasn't possible anymore since the items had been sent. Today, no 'initial update', nothing from Ikea either. They just leave me dangling. A good customer service would mean they either send the items again immediately, with me having to promise to send the first parcel back, in case it appeared again miraculously, and them sorting out the problem with the delivery company which, after all, they have chosen, or cancelling the order with a full refund. Instead, I have to wait a week, with no idea what will happen after that. I freely admit that I am a bit spoilt, being so impatient. But a customer-friendly company today simply delivers when promised or tries their utmost to remedy the situation if this does not happen and not just lets their customers wait. I have come to expect such a good service since most companies with online business offer it. Not Ikea, though. This will probably have been my last order with them, whatever happens with this package.  P.S. I finally got Ikea to send a replacement. But, lo and behold - the next day the lost parcel was obviously found again and finally delivered, after a short additional delay. DPD apologized repeatedly for the delay, Ikea didn't. So even the fact that the package finally arrived does not merit more than one additional star. The customer service could have been a lot better.

                This is a specific review to IKEA Barendrecht. They made a mistake with a delivery date and they are not even accessible to the customers.

                Not a great experience. I ordered a table from Ikea to be delivered on a Saturday as I work Sunday to Friday. I ordered some other things with it and the delivery service brought the smaller things but not the table. I then re-scheduled it for my next day off, the following Saturday, when it did arrive. Then Christmas happened, so the next available Saturday, I was ready to put it together. However, it was completely damaged on every corner. I called customer services who said that they would send somebody to get it, on the next Saturday. I gave up 4 Saturdays for a table that I couldn't put up! No compensation offer, nothing. And still no table!

                Ikea is great to shop for affordable furniture and their furniture is durable.  I own a few pieces and have recommended some to friends.  When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting over Thanksgiving I took them to the Columbus, OH store where they purchased a table top and 4 table legs.  They were moving to a new apartment in January - 6 hours away in Michigan.  When they moved in to their apartment, they attempted to assemble their table but one of the legs had a manufacturing defect and would not thread.  We called the Columbus store and at first were told that we could return the $4.00 leg and get a replacement.  My son explained they were 6 hours away from where they purchased it.  He was told there was a store in Canton MI, but of course that was a mere 4 hours away. It would be highly inconvenient for them to make the 4 hour trip for a $4.00 leg, could they please send a new one?  He said he was willing to pay for a new leg, he just didn't want to pay the shipping.  I could return the defective one if necessary when I returned to Ohio.  The CS representative told him she could not do that, so he asked for a supervisor.  After some discussion, the supervisor appeared to understand the dilemma and appeared to want to help.  He said he would send one out, he said he would send a shipping notice to my sons email when it was shipped, etc.  When I first wrote this review I gave IKEA a one star because after all the talk, my son didn't receive a notification or anything and I really didn't think IKEA was going to send the leg, but I was on my way back to OH and my daughter-in-law called and said the leg had come!   Thanks, IKEA.  You came through!  I can fully recommend even distance travelers!

They sent my shipment to my billing address which is in a different state, instead of sending it to my shipping address. The first time they did this, I had to spend over 2 hours on the phone, and they apologised for their mistake. They then re delivered the items, to my billing address again! 2nd time around. I had to spend another 2 plus hours and they apologized and had to re submit a new order.  They re -submitted my order and said they could deliver on the 20th of Jan. I cancelled my order.

                I honestly don't know where to begin. I can understand it. For so many years, I've turned to Ikea stores for every-thing. In fact, years ago, I furnished 2 homes with so much Ikea product that people would comment that I lived in an Ikea show-room! And, back then, I couldn't have been happier with quality, price, selection.  In the past 6 months, I've had cause to re-furnish a new home and went directly to Ikea (on-line this time). From tea-lites to table-tops the experience has been nothing less than a horror.  1st: On-line shopping? The selection of furnishings, small and large resemble toss-aways that even our local ""thrift"" wouldn't accept. Hideous, horrific materials, and the prices are gut-wrenchingly unrealistic! ""High"" would be a kind descriptive. ""Extortion"" is close.  2. Still on-line, go through the trouble of adding to cart, hitting the ""check-out"", enter info. Verify. Confirm. BANG! The message: ""Item Not Buyable"". Not ""buyable""? Grammar. Vocabulary. Even non-English speakers know better. Never mind, no explanation for the ""not buyable"". Ah, but experience? Beware, the cost of the ""not buyable"" item(s) MAY have already been charged to your account/card. Which brings me to...  3. ""Customer Service"". If ""service"" is what you need, you're best advised to talk with your fridge. At least that will give you a buzz or hum or some sort of sound. Ikea? Repeatedly the recorded telephone message simply claims ""We did not receive your response. Good-bye."" And, you're disconnected. Dead line. Try contacting them on-line, via ""chat"" or e-mail and the best you get is empty promises in a dialect of some sort of obvious accent that even native speakers of what-ever language has been translated wouldn't/couldn't comprehend. But ""promises"" will be made, and absolute silence will follow. You bought it? You're stuck with it as it is. To Ikea? You're the fool.  4. For something as small as a package of tea-lites, the package claims ""Made in the USA"". Well? 25 per-cent don't light, 25 per-cent don't stay lit, and over-all, 75 percent look as if they'd been chewed by some sort of some-thing, literally! The ""wax"" doesn't melt, it deteriorates in to some sort of granular matter. Even at their ""reasonable"" pricing, when you order 100 and 50 are worthless, the ""bargain"" is gone. Return? Replace? Refund? ""LOL"", as they say. As I've already said: You bought it? It's yours. Deal with it.  I brought a matter to my local Attorney General's office recently. I ordered an item, at the end of the transaction I received the ""Not Buyable"" message BUT, the money mysteriously disappeared. I paid, but no receipt or confirmation of transaction was ever produced. It's been weeks of mystery, and nothing but deflective, cryptic messages, essential of denial and refusal from Ikea. Thankfully, the cost wasn't of a major amount. I've since gone else-where, purchased the needed item (alternative suffices) and chalked it all up to ""education"". I've learnt: No matter what it is that I want, Ikea doesn't have it, doesn't offer it and I can't afford it, when considering the aggravation and what I see as ""insult"" that comes with the Ikea deal.  It's sad, really. it used to be fun and delightful to shop Ikea. These days I wouldn't sully my house-hold their refuse.

                First of all, their customer service: only available via social media (FB, Twitter) and phone. What is someone does NOT want to have social media account just to communicate with them, and their phone services is... Er zijn 12 vachtende voor u... Second: now items available online, but even delivering it to a shop costs you 9.99eur... Ripping off. The website says for ordering the online items: ""Dit product is alleen online te bestellen OF VIA EEN MEDEWERKER IN DE WINKEL"": now this last one you can forget. In the shop they said it is a different system, they could not order it. And, when you finally decided to order it online, you go to your basket, the item is ""op voorraad"", and when you hit the Order button: ""Het spijt ons, de gekozen artikelen zijn nit op voorraad. Check the beschikbaarheid morgen nogmals""  And last but not least, since 5 years they could not reset my password for my account :-) What about GDPR???

I recently been ordering stuff online and to get someone on the phone to clarify, confirm or make changes to and order or delivery window has taken hours of my time. Every single time I called it was at least 30 min wait time only for someone to answer and then another 30 min at least for someone to do something about the issue.

They kept me up to date with my delivery day and time and the delivery drivers delivered bang on time.  They were very professional and polite.  No issues with the packaging at all, all in tact and very very secure.  All items were well packaged and were as expected.  The only niggle I have is being charged £39 for delivery when I’d spent nearly £500 on goods.

                This is the worst experience I’ve ever had in my 50 years of buying furnishings and cabinets. It’s impossible to put this cheap stuff together. They give me no clues. All I wanna do is take it back get my money and forget about this horrible experience. It is a lot of money for a cheap particleboard that breaks when you try to put a screw in it correctly. Please don’t throw your money away like I did. I am an attorney and I do not think that this place will last long with this kind of service and bad quality.

                @ikeawinnipeg I tried to return a LACK coffee table that’s still inside the package unopened with a slight tear in plastic packaging.  I lost my receipt and I am fully aware of the policy of having a receipt.  However, I figured since the item was still unopened, I should at least get a store credit on the item.   But they flat out said NO because there’s a tear in the plastic.  I had to argue with the customer rep and told them that plastic is meant to tear and they don’t normally stay intact especially if it accidentally rubs onto something.  But she still wouldn’t take it because they won’t be able to resell the product even though the item is obviously intact, no damage except for the little plastic tear...UNBELIEVABLE!!!!   The WORST return policy I have ever heard and the WORST customer service ever😡

                We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems.  After we bought the 1st order on a ""click and collect"" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him.  For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned.  The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no.  They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more.

                IKEA’s customer service is so bad that I had to call 20 times to talk to a rep to report a problem with the items delivered to me. They have delivered full/double size bed frame side rails for a queen bed. I have paid for their delivery and assembly services. I was told that they will send me the correct items in a week and left me with no options other than to hire a contractor for assembly again. I have paid for assembly once already. I would not recommend IKEA for buying furniture.

                Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back.

                Considerably the worst online shopping experience I have ever had no exaggeration. Spent $500 to have furniture for a get together and 3 weeks later the delivery has failed 3 times because no delivery rep has called once they have arrived and automatically ship it back saying the delivery has failed even though they make you wait in a 5 hour window to sign for it. Call customer support and get transferred around to different reps who leave no notes or have any idea of whats going on in a different department. Fifth time on hold this week for a total wait time of 2.5 hours. Please please shop at Wayfair, amazon literally any other retailer with a better customer experience.

                Service was excellent. No issues from me. Only issue is, the staff were a bit rude at times. However, the great selection of furniture had my family jumping for joy.

                Do not buy from ikea Shame on you!!!  I have never encountered in my life such a bad and poor customer service and behavior. I went to ilea exactly 7pm. So my first trolley was full I left it aside as they asked me to do and took another trolley and filled it as well along with 3000 furniture purchase So total is around 5000 aed and there was going to be another visit to finish my purchase.  So by 11:20 pm I finished my shopping and I went to collect my first trolley turn out they took it and empty everything in it.      Imagine shopping from 7 pm to 11 pm while being extremely sick ? I tor appart my bill and left as no one was helping me. I asked several times for the manager and no one came The employee was not helpful or co-opporating to help me, all he did was going to other employee to tell them what happend and also he said I told them it is someone trolley but they didn’t listen. I went to customer service after being frustrated all she said was “sorry”  Where do I exchange the 4 hour shopping and wasting my time with ur sorry. She didn’t even stop me to fix the problem.  IKEA you a dis-grace to your industry and very disappointing the kind of employee u hire. I will make sure to leave my bad reviews all over for people to be cautious and I would recommend them to visit other stores in dubai atleast they have good employee who know what they are doing and excellent  customer  service . U just lost 5k today from one client and I will make sure to do many steps in the future to notify people and I hope I lose clients

                I honestly don't know where to begin. I can understand it. For so many years, I've turned to Ikea stores for every-thing. In fact, years ago, I furnished 2 homes with so much Ikea product that people would comment that I lived in an Ikea show-room! And, back then, I couldn't have been happier with quality, price, selection.  In the past 6 months, I've had cause to re-furnish a new home and went directly to Ikea (on-line this time). From tea-lites to table-tops the experience has been nothing less than a horror.  1st: On-line shopping? The selection of furnishings, small and large resemble toss-aways that even our local ""thrift"" wouldn't accept. Hideous, horrific materials, and the prices are gut-wrenchingly unrealistic! ""High"" would be a kind descriptive. ""Extortion"" is close.  2. Still on-line, go through the trouble of adding to cart, hitting the ""check-out"", enter info. Verify. Confirm. BANG! The message: ""Item Not Buyable"". Not ""buyable""? Grammar. Vocabulary. Even non-English speakers know better. Never mind, no explanation for the ""not buyable"". Ah, but experience? Beware, the cost of the ""not buyable"" item(s) MAY have already been charged to your account/card. Which brings me to...  3. ""Customer Service"". If ""service"" is what you need, you're best advised to talk with your fridge. At least that will give you a buzz or hum or some sort of sound. Ikea? Repeatedly the recorded telephone message simply claims ""We did not receive your response. Good-bye."" And, you're disconnected. Dead line. Try contacting them on-line, via ""chat"" or e-mail and the best you get is empty promises in a dialect of some sort of obvious accent that even native speakers of what-ever language has been translated wouldn't/couldn't comprehend. But ""promises"" will be made, and absolute silence will follow. You bought it? You're stuck with it as it is. To Ikea? You're the fool.  4. For something as small as a package of tea-lites, the package claims ""Made in the USA"". Well? 25 per-cent don't light, 25 per-cent don't stay lit, and over-all, 75 percent look as if they'd been chewed by some sort of some-thing, literally! The ""wax"" doesn't melt, it deteriorates in to some sort of granular matter. Even at their ""reasonable"" pricing, when you order 100 and 50 are worthless, the ""bargain"" is gone. Return? Replace? Refund? ""LOL"", as they say. As I've already said: You bought it? It's yours. Deal with it.  I brought a matter to my local Attorney General's office recently. I ordered an item, at the end of the transaction I received the ""Not Buyable"" message BUT, the money mysteriously disappeared. I paid, but no receipt or confirmation of transaction was ever produced. It's been weeks of mystery, and nothing but deflective, cryptic messages, essential of denial and refusal from Ikea. Thankfully, the cost wasn't of a major amount. I've since gone else-where, purchased the needed item (alternative suffices) and chalked it all up to ""education"". I've learnt: No matter what it is that I want, Ikea doesn't have it, doesn't offer it and I can't afford it, when considering the aggravation and what I see as ""insult"" that comes with the Ikea deal.  It's sad, really. it used to be fun and delightful to shop Ikea. These days I wouldn't sully my house-hold their refuse.

                First of all, their customer service: only available via social media (FB, Twitter) and phone. What is someone does NOT want to have social media account just to communicate with them, and their phone services is... Er zijn 12 vachtende voor u... Second: now items available online, but even delivering it to a shop costs you 9.99eur... Ripping off. The website says for ordering the online items: ""Dit product is alleen online te bestellen OF VIA EEN MEDEWERKER IN DE WINKEL"": now this last one you can forget. In the shop they said it is a different system, they could not order it. And, when you finally decided to order it online, you go to your basket, the item is ""op voorraad"", and when you hit the Order button: ""Het spijt ons, de gekozen artikelen zijn nit op voorraad. Check the beschikbaarheid morgen nogmals""  And last but not least, since 5 years they could not reset my password for my account :-) What about GDPR???

                Love IKEA furniture and have been a loyal customer for years, but their customer service it ridiculous! I recently been ordering stuff online and to get someone on the phone to clarify, confirm or make changes to and order or delivery window has taken hours of my time. Every single time I called it was at least 30 min wait time only for someone to answer and then another 30 min at least for someone to do something about the issue. Pathetic service, a company this big should really do something about their customer service department, it makes the whole shopping experience dreadful and negative.

                IKEA’s customer service is so bad that I had to call 20 times to talk to a rep to report a problem with the items delivered to me. They have delivered full/double size bed frame side rails for a queen bed. I have paid for their delivery and assembly services. I was told that they will send me the correct items in a week and left me with no options other than to hire a contractor for assembly again. I have paid for assembly once already. I would not recommend IKEA for buying furniture.

                Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back.

                Fake return policy.  Recent change to their return policy as of Nov 1, 2019.  You have to have a receipt or card for them to return the item. They will not accept even if the product is damaged and refused to give you a store credit.  Hang onto those receipts.  Not happy!!   We traveled two hours to return them and then had to donate it to ikea as we had no room in the car.  Definitely not a 365 return policy.

                Ordered a sofa to be delivered this morning and no one ever rang the door bell. Given that I’m in a flat I’m not sure how else I’m supposed to know if the delivery is here?  I called customer service and have now had to book for two days time (could be any time that day no fixed delivery slot). Even when I raised the issue of the delivery guys not ringing the bell that didn’t count for anything. Why exactly did I pay £39? I can’t see it reflected in your delivery or customer service...

                I ordered a cupboard that arrived damaged as the people who delivered it probably dropped it.  IKEA expects me to wait again at home for another builder to come and put the cupboard together without offering a compensation on the working hours I lost. They have the worst service I’ve encountered.

                Rubbish service. Ikea still owe me brimnes wardrobe but they are refusing to take responsibility. 3door brimnes wardrobe was delivered with box 3 missing. Waited 3-4 weeks for delivery to be reattempted. An entire brimnes wardrobe was delivered but this time box 3 was open with stuff missing. And IKEA were more focused on recovering the extra boxes delivered to my property rather than sorting out my problem. Awful experience. My first and last time shopping at ikea.

                IKEA - Such shocking service! Last resort, the driver has turned off his phone!! Saturday, first delivery was damaged and therefore declined. Second attempt for Tuesday was then altered by IKEA to Thursday! Today was very late! After speaking to customer service earlier in the week (3 times) including a young man who just sniffed his cold continuously down the phone at me, I was given an assurance of the delivery time. 2 hours after, it finally arrived. This has cost us money with being away from work. Never intend on using IKEA again, cannot recommend #IKEAPOORSERVICE

                Not only do you pay £40 for a 6 hour window for a delivery service, which is ridiculous, but when it actually arrives a week later having tumbled around the van all the while, their customer services will not refund you for the service you did not get. Once they have your money it's tough luck.

                BEWARE - IKEA removes bad review for their products from their website citing ""policy violation"" and refuses to explain which exactly policy does it violation when you talk to their customer service. This practice is as bad as quality of their products. So I'll post my experience with their product here for everyone to read.  I know IKEA makes cheap furniture, I do not expect much believe me. But I was horrified how degraded IKEA quality over the years. I have a bookcase that I have purchased from IKEA about 10 years ago and it's a solid piece of wood, it's heavy constructed, still holding up fine. I wanted to replace it with two of these bookcases thinking that I'll be getting similar build level. I was so wrong. I guess IKEA cut all possible corners in 10 years to make it as cheap as it can be to manufacture. It's so flimsy and unstable, the sides are not solid pieces but just a frame with think inserts. The bookcase is constructed in a such way that it can not be put flush against a wall if you have baseboard because the read ""legs"" do not have a cutout for it. Quality of woodwork is horrible - it's uneven, unrefined and plain bad. Two of my side boards are not even glued properly and sliding back and forth in slots. I'm not going to talk about the design because it's non-existent. Paint is as cheap as everything else and while it's called dark-brown it's in reality simply black probably for the purpose of hiding bad wood quality. I will repeat again, I was extremely disappointed when I have unpacked the bookcase, this whole thing just screams in your face - CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Now I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my time to try to put it together or I can just throw it away immediately. I wouldn't complain if it would cost you $50 but for $150 this is just a robbery in a daylight. I will never recommend to anyone to buy anything in IKEA from now on, IKEA quality went too downhill in the last years.

                I made a partial order for my kitchen. They did not have it in stock at my local IKEA store. I had to make an order online and then pick it up at a delivery point. All good so far.  My nightmare started when I was ready to to finalise my order with the other items. As before, not in stock at the local IKEA store. No worries I make an online order and pick it up at a delivery point. Order about to be finalised and when the options for delivery comes up I have 3 to choose from. And the closest will have me 580 kilometers going by car. I ask the support what is going on and they say that it is no system error. I told them that I ordered last week and you delivered locally.    - Yes, for these items we did, but not these ones you order now.   I tell them that the items are in the same series and I must have the same style in my kitchen. You must be wrong?   - Nope, it is correct  So, with this I MUST WARN YOU. If you want IKEA...DO NOT BUY ONLINE and think they can deliver.

Everything was in box, now after decoration ended, I opened the boxes and main part of beds are missing, Ikea told me than yes we made mistake, we didn't send you everything, but you should check and told us. That means I had to do their jobs as well. Now I can't use the beds at all. Three of them.

Customer Service Manager rude and disrespectful. Prices displayed wrongly. Employees ignore you and continue chatting group of 4. No smile, no help, no apology. Even products have changed.

                I purchase whole beds, wardrobes and kitchen stuffs worth more than €1000 in June 2018. From Ikea Valencia. Everything was in box, now after decoration ended, I opened the boxes and main part of beds are missing, Ikea told me than yes we made mistake, we didn't send you everything, but you should check and told us. That means I had to do their jobs as well. Now I can't use the beds at all. Three of them. Worst company worst service Not recommend at all.Compré camas enteras, armarios y artículos de cocina por valor de más de € 1000 en junio de 2018. Todo estaba en caja, ahora después de que terminó la decoración, abrí las cajas y falta la parte principal de las camas, Ikea me dijo que sí, cometimos un error, nosotros  no le envié todo, pero debe verificarlo y contárnoslo.  Eso significa que también tuve que hacer su trabajo.  Ahora no puedo usar las camas en absoluto.  Tres de ellos.  La peor compañía, el peor servicio No lo recomiendo en absoluto.

Ikea,Furniture,2 stars: Poor,"
                Very poor online experience. Tried to order some stuff. Web page checkout is quite impossible to work with. At the end I got my order in ""ghost"" mode. I can see my card being reserved for certain amount but IKEA web is now showing me my order nor did it give me any order number to track. Same goes for my card provider, they did not list my order number nor do they provide me with a way to contact the IKEA for that particular thing as the amount is only reserved but not confirmed by IKEA.

                Moving to a new country, I've used IKEA to outfit my house. With two different deliveries, they've gotten everything just right. The timing was great, products were exactly as ordered, and delivery men were polite (and even tried to speak English with me to be helpful). Excellent work, IKEA, Brno, Czech Republic.

                Very disappointed! We were moving into a new place and made sure to order early (Nov. 25, 2019) so we have it on time. We bought a sofa bed, bed frame, TV stand, dining set, duvet, pillows, etc. from them. Delivery was supposed to be on Nov 30, 2019. They said everything was on track. We waited for 4 hours and called XPO and IKEA several times with a LOT of waiting time on the phone only to find out that it was not coming and no one updated us regarding this. We had to call and reschedule.   Same thing happened for Dec. 2 delivery and again on Dec. 5. XPO and IKEA staff were giving false updates and have NO IDEA where our orders are. Either they weren't being transparent or have no clue at all.   We ended up having to cancel because when we called them again, they said it was in the WRONG warehouse and was going to be delivered on Dec. 10...  They were very unapologetic about it and did not even offer any solutions. Would NOT recommend this to anyone! We wasted so much of our time calling and waiting. Worst service ever!

                Products are ok but delivery and customer service is terrible.   Ordered for friend and came to her house especially for delivery which tracking kept saying was on time.   Right up to an hour after items should have been delivered it kept saying it was on its way. Finally contacted IKEA and they say ""Oh its not coming today it will be another week""   OK but why did they not phone me - they have my number - no e mail , no SMS nothing so a completely wasted journey and day.

                We've approached ikea for remodeling of our kitchen they've suggested to pay 3000 so that the planner would visit our home and take the measurements and give us the design and we wouldn't have to visit the store until the selection of the counter top and other products. As told, planner has visited along with other personal and took the measurements (which also happened after many follow ups). They've sent us the plan which didn't include the whole kitchen but a part of it (which also was done late). Later after contacting the planner she said she would send the whole plan the very next day but it has been weeks that there is no progress nor the design was sent. They have not replied to calls or mails. Such a poor service. Didn't expect such a bad service from them. Being a reputed brand shameful for having done this. This is not the reason we have paid 3k.

                We went into store to buy a mattress for our granddaughter. We chose the hyllestad pocket sprung mattress after trying in store and with advice from the staff. We purchased a medium mattress and were reassured by the staff who said that we had 365 days to return it if it wasn’t suitable.  We put the mattress in place however the  mattress is rock hard with a ridge in it. We telephoned customer services who said that the 365 day return policy did not apply to mattresses as stated online. We were not told this in store. We have been advised that we can only exchange it for an alternative however Ikea  acknowledge that the next mattress up isn’t  available in a single. When we said it was not the same as the in store model that we had trialled customer  services said that the store mattresses weren’t like the ones sold as people had tried them?? and  they advised us to sleep on it until it became comfortable. Our granddaughter is only four and weighs just over 2 stones therefore her altering the mattress would be an impossibility! The mattress has been removed and is standing in our hallway as we have no use for it. We tried to write this review on the Ikea Website however Ikea have censored the review and have prevented us from submitting it. We have wasted a significant amount of time and money and will not purchase from Ikea again. We are shocked by the way Ikea have dealt with this problem and by the fact that they would not publish a truthful review. Shame on you Ikea!.

                IKEA customer service is awful if you need to have them pull furniture.  so, expect to wait over 30 minutes when they aren’t even busy.  Next, you really can’t exchange - you can only return and then go through the incredibly long line again as they help can’t go get one and let you exchange.  So, after waiting over 35 minutes to get a desk - i couldn’t exchange something.  Poor customer service - especially as the pullers and return people were just standing around.  Crazy!

I’ve purchased a whole kitchen from there for thousands of pounds and this is the one item needed to finish it off.  It is not available at the store for pick up and they refuse to send it over from their warehouse even though they have other items shipped over to the store from there daily.  I wish I’d never bought anything from Ikea, this will definitely be the last time. Rather spend my money at a place they know what customer care is.

                I use ikea often. I buy bulbs from them because the bulbs have great life guarantees  At least that's what I thought. 2 x E27 600 lm I bought last year went faulty. Both flash off and on and make crackling sounds so I brought them back to the store yesterday. I had no receipt but was certain they would replace the bulbs, but NO. They said they couldn't  see on their system where I had ever bought bulbs on my family card and refused my request. I know my card wasnt recognised by their scanner a couple of times and they replaced my faulty card but this was rejected by the returns department. I'm very disappointed by this matter because the bottom line here is that these bulbs are obviously not as good as the IKEA staff member told me they were when he said they had a lifetime guarantee. He said if they go faulty, just return them and IKEA will replace them. Not true.

                IKEA customer service is awful if you need to have them pull furniture.  so, expect to wait over 30 minutes when they arenâ€™t even busy.  Next, you really canâ€™t exchange - you can only return and then go through the incredibly long line again as they help canâ€™t go get one and let you exchange.  So, after waiting over 35 minutes to get a desk - i couldnâ€™t exchange something.  Poor customer service - especially as the pullers and return people were just standing around.  Crazy!

                Trying to charge someone £40 for delivery when the item itself is £35 is greedy and disgusting.   I’ve purchased a whole kitchen from there for thousands of pounds and this is the one item needed to finish it off.  It is not available at the store for pick up and they refuse to send it over from their warehouse even though they have other items shipped over to the store from there daily.  I wish I’d never bought anything from Ikea, this will definitely be the last time. Rather spend my money at a place they know what customer care is.

                Extremely bad experience with their kitchen installation service. Still today, 3 months after the installation they need to process the refund for the 300euro overcharge. The installation service heavily damaged my new floor in the kitchen and nobody is replying my emails nor calls.  Do not use their installation service. Really expensive and extremely bad quality

                I use ikea often. I buy bulbs from them because the bulbs have great life guarantees  At least that's what I thought. 2 x E27 600 lm I bought last year went faulty. Both flash off and on and make crackling sounds so I brought them back to the store yesterday. I had no receipt but was certain they would replace the bulbs, but NO. They said they couldn't  see on their system where I had ever bought bulbs on my family card and refused my request. I know my card wasnt recognised by their scanner a couple of times and they replaced my faulty card but this was rejected by the returns department. I'm very disappointed by this matter because the bottom line here is that these bulbs are obviously not as good as the IKEA staff member told me they were when he said they had a lifetime guarantee. He said if they go faulty, just return them and IKEA will replace them. Not true.

                We had the worst experience with the third party delivery company (XPO) IKEA uses in NY City. Their staff were incompetent, rude and aggressive with my husband and our building manager / concierge. XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem.   My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City. The time you would spend resolving problems with the delivery company would cost you a lot more than just buying your furniture elsewhere.

                Every single time I call to try to get help for my order I keep getting the same message - We did not receive your selection. Goodbye. Then it just automatically drops my calls.  I was finally able to find some contact email to get through to them.  So basically I put in a huge order almost 2 weeks ago and they were missing an entire couch I ordered. I've been trying to get them to send me my couch but so far no luck and one basic email saying how sorry they are. So far worst customer service ever. Not sure what to do. I really expect better for such a huge company.

                Horrific, third party delivery company employed by IKEA. If you cant pick it up at the store and take it with you BEWARE! Let me just tell you that if you do not heed this advice and you trust them to deliver something to you in a manner that you will find pleasing and excellent....YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK! I had to reschedule a delivery for some stand up mirrors (that I ordered online and spent over $500.00 + dollars for.  I was challenged by uncaring, incapable and at worse, ignorant service personnel at every turn. To be fair, the employees of the third party deliver service that IKEA contracts with in the San Diego County area were the ones that I would corral into the ignorant and uncaring category. However, some of the staff at IKEA's 800 number fell into this category as well. It got to a point where they were mad at me for being frustrated. As if I didn't have a right after 3 failed delivery attempts (and broken promises by them) and me taking 2 days off from work to be there to receive my product and no delivery people showing up....and not even having the courtesy to call me and tell me that they weren't coming? The service failures are so egregious it nearly borders on conspiracy theory material.   To this day, I have still never received my shipment nor gotten a refund. I even responded to several of their automated follow up messages and gave them a 1 star.....I still never heard anything from whomever was supposed to be monitoring the customer review process! It defies logic.  I have never wished ill upon any company other than the perhaps say, the IRS. However, I do sadly hope that IKEA goes the way of the dodo bird and becomes extinct. This is because I truly feel they don't care about me/us enough to step up and listen when their clients are asking for their help.   P.S. I noticed when looking for review sites for IKEA, that the independent review sites that IKEA does not control have VERY low scores from customers. However, IKEA's own client feedback site seems to contradict that with much higher aggregate reviews???? Um, who's review site do you trust? Pretty safe to say that the independent review sites like this one with an average customer review score of just over 2 is probably a lot closer to the truth. I hope this review has been helpful.

She booked the taxi for me , helped to get the Taxi to the parking lot , helped with my items in one of the trolleys and this is a MAGIC.

                Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.  I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc.  I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never. In Germany things look different.   I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.  Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment.   Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:  1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service.  I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours.  The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated ""support"" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.  2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.  3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English.  In Denmark it's not a problem.  I am truly disappointed by Ikea.  My attitude to the company has changed dramatically.  I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.  With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave.  If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.  That's all.

                Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.  For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.  All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.  UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before.

                We designed our wardrobe (PAX) in their program. Everything seemed great until we got our delivery. Somehow An additional wardrobe was added to our order which we paid for as well. The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up. I used to be an IKEA fan, bought my kitchen there for +100.000 SEK but no more IKEA for me after this dreadful service.

                Where do I start.  I purchased a desk on the 29 Oct and exactly 1 year and 1 day later the drawer facia fell apart along the grain.  When contacting both the store and customer services it was explained that because it was out of the 1 year warranty there was nothing they could do.  This I can accept, however, there is no way of getting a new facia which means I either buy a new desk just to obtain the facia or as suggested by Cutomer Services, I look on eBay.  Then I ask if there is any further way of complaining I am told no.  I cannot even contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part.  Great Customer at the heart process, I don't think so.

That’s all it said, two days later I showed up at the store to pick up my order, and apparently it had been refunded and returned. Because I didn’t pick it up that same day I got the email. The email said nothing like I have 24 hours to pick up the items or they’re being returned. The things I bought were on sale and they are not honoring the sale price of me having to go back and buy them again. They also never communicated that the items are being refunded and returned.

Where you will receive the same message again and again and again.  A continuous irritating loop resulting in zero progress. No wonder why their call volume is higher than normal.  I wouldn't do this again

                I bought some home things from IKEA but I had issue with taking them home. I wanted a Taxi instead of home delivery because I need those items immediately. The lady that entertain me went a long mile beyond my imagine. She booked the taxi for me , helped to get the Taxi to the parking lot , helped with my items in one of the trolleys and this is a MAGIC. Imagine , I am few days in Australia and knows nowhere but the Lady (Elena) at IKEA RICHMOND Melbourne made the difference. What a super good customer experience. IKEA for Life . Thankyou to Elena and IKEA.

                Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.  I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc.  I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never. In Germany things look different.   I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.  Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment.   Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:  1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service.  I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours.  The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated ""support"" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.  2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.  3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English.  In Denmark it's not a problem.  I am truly disappointed by Ikea.  My attitude to the company has changed dramatically.  I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.  With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave.  If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.  That's all.

                Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.  For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.  All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.  UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before.

                We designed our wardrobe (PAX) in their program. Everything seemed great until we got our delivery. Somehow An additional wardrobe was added to our order which we paid for as well. The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up. I used to be an IKEA fan, bought my kitchen there for +100.000 SEK but no more IKEA for me after this dreadful service.

                Where do I start.  I purchased a desk on the 29 Oct and exactly 1 year and 1 day later the drawer facia fell apart along the grain.  When contacting both the store and customer services it was explained that because it was out of the 1 year warranty there was nothing they could do.  This I can accept, however, there is no way of getting a new facia which means I either buy a new desk just to obtain the facia or as suggested by Cutomer Services, I look on eBay.  Then I ask if there is any further way of complaining I am told no.  I cannot even contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part.  Great Customer at the heart process, I don't think so.

                Click and collect program is garbage. I received an email stating that my order was ready for pick up. That’s all it said, two days later I showed up at the store to pick up my order, and apparently it had been refunded and returned. Because I didn’t pick it up that same day I got the email. The email said nothing like I have 24 hours to pick up the items or they’re being returned. The things I bought were on sale and they are not honoring the sale price of me having to go back and buy them again. They also never communicated that the items are being refunded and returned. I still have not been refunded on my credit card, they said they will process the transaction eventually. They need way better communication and customer service. I wouldn’t recommend using the click and collect service. Unless you’re waiting by your email for the notice to go get your items immediately.

                I ordered 9 items and only 2 came. After waiting on the phone for over an hour (surprise) I decided to email. They replied quickly and sent a replacement. In my replacement for 7 items, only ANOTHER TWO came. And those 2 items were the WRONG size. At this point I was over it and asked for a refund. My refund was supposed to be $21 I got refunded $6. I don't know what's going on over there but what a mess! Literally every thing they did was messed up. I love Ikea but the online site is a nightmare.

                Paid for their kitchen measuring service in order to get an estimate for kitchen installation.  Forget about followup, there is none.  Also have tried to call 4 times to their kitchen service department, all you will ever get is a message that they are too busy to take your call, please call again.  I would never purchase their kitchen cabinets and installation, because you would never get any service from them if you had a problem.

                Worst delivery experience, when first of all they tell you that you are going be delivered between 1 to 5pm and the transporter call you almost at 5pm to say that he is going to delivery your item in 1h. If you want to make sure to have your package from IKEA, choose a off day! You must stay all day long for them... So I couldn’t be at home during that time, they returned my package without saying nothing. No email from the transporter, no email from IKEA.. I had to call the service of IKEA (had to wait from at least 30-40min to have them on phone..) to be able to reschedule my delivery, and now they tell me that it not possible until next week.  Please make sure that if you buy from IKEA that you can pick up your furniture in person at the store ! You will always have issue with their delivery services...

                Horrible delivery process from Select Express!! First time around they never called me so I wasn't home. Then was told by IKEA that I would be charged for a re-delivery which was only waived after 45 minutes on the phone explaining and re-explaining why I should not be charged. Once it was rescheduled and confirmed by automated process, I waited at home during the entire 4 hour window but no delivery truck showed up. Another hour on the phone (mostly on hold) to try to straighten things out.  This time I was told that the delivery company never received the items from IKEA. What a mess!

                Worst experience I had in a while. They didn't come during the window they were supposed to deliver the items. They told me the best would be to cancel and pick it up at the store, which I did, but they never refunded the shipping cost and wont' do it. Then I bought the items online to pick up. When we went to pick up the items, the person said the items weren't there even though we had a confirmation email. Again, I lost money and time and nothing. They are also super slow to respond by email and sometimes never get back to you. When one calls, it is a crap shoot. Sometimes they answer, mostly the automated voice hang up because of volume of calls. Unfortunately, I will never buy from ikea ever again.

                Honestly, does any one really rave about Kitchenaide quality.  The only thing amazing with satin black fridge and stove is the look.  The slide in ceramic top stove use is dismal.  Slow heating elements makes it frustrating.  Coming from a coil electric stove this is just disappointing.  Yeah, it is easier to clean ( sort of) but use is frustrating.  Why should one have to wait so long for the element to heat up and get ready.  The touch screen is not easier.  What’s wrong with dials that one can’t reset by accident.  Fridge looks great but space inside is less.  So much is taken up with the water/ice making portion that the vegg and fruit boxes are way too small.  The interior is 80% plastic that won’t last.  The interior temp. Set at 38 freezes stuff on the top shelf.  Go figure. The only appliance of the set of three I spent more than $5000 for that is worthy of praise is the dishwasher.  Definitely will not buy another thing with Kitchenaide written on it.

                Horrible customer service. I called several times and talk with 4 people to get a replacement for a toaster. Twice I was told that they placed the order but I never got it. I will not call back as I was placed on hold every time for at least one hour.

                I received my heavy duty KitchenAid mixer for a Christmas present December 2019 I started having problems with it exactly after a year I called and asked what can be done and they said sorry there is no warranty it's only for the first year why pay $600 for a machine when you don't get customer service or a warranty is longer than a year now my mixer is toast and I have to go and buy another one I won't buying KitchenAid again the sad part is I have all the attachments to go with my KitchenAid mixer the pasta maker all that kind of stuff so I'm screwed either way...so if anyone is really thinking about get one DONT BUY ONE...GET SOMETHING ELSE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Pretty sad KitchenAid does not stand behind their products

                Loses a star simply because the website is so awful. You are encouraged to register your warranty on the KitchenAid website with the lure of free goodies if you do. However, the warranty form - as noted by a previous reviewer - simply crashes out with an error at the end of the process. Bit of a waste of time and doesn't make a good impression. It appears this has been a problem for some time.

                We bought three mixers for company X'mas party draw last December.  However, after we received the order we decided to return two mixers for credit and hoping to get something else.  Then we returned one at the end of Dec and returned the second one in mid-Jan 2020.  As of now, we still have not received any refunds on the credit card after numerous calls to Customer Service and the CS supervisor. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY CONSUMERS BUY DIRECT FROM KITCHEN-AID.  IT IS BETTER OFF TO BUY DIRECTLY FROM ANY RETAILERS.

                My wife bought a Kitchenaid Artisan toaster a while ago. We were uanable to register it through the Belgian contact details provided as there was never any answer. Shortly after purchase, the right hand 2 toaster elements stopped working and again we were unable to make contact with Kitchen aid. So we currently have half a working toaster and are unable to contact the manufacturer.

                I bought a stand up mixer on line with an estimated delivery day of 04/09/20. I also received an email  saying it was shipped. When I didn't receive the order I called KitchenAid and they told me it was ready to ship but the could not tell me ""when it will be actually ship"". I then asked to cancel the order and I was told that they can't because it was ready to be ship, but they don't know when they will ship it. That is ridiculous they lied about the delivery day, they never ship it and now they can't cancel because ""it is ready to ship???"" Worst customer service, They are quick to get your money but they will not fulfill the orders you paid already. That is theft and false advertisement. They also disconnected the order status page so you can't check any progress on the order. Worst company. I will never buy anything from this company again

                The mixer arrived in good condition except the height adjustment was way off. I researched solutions for this and found that there is an adjustment screw and there is a test you can do with a dime which allows you to adjust the bowl height if it needs to be adjusted a minimal amount however mine came from the factory so far out it could not be adjusted so I contacted customer service because I had read that they would walk you through the solutions to fix it and if it could not be fixed they would send you a new one and you would send the defective one back.  Well, after speaking with Alex the customer service guy he instructed me to take a video of the dime test after each adjustment of the screw and attach it to an email he sent me. He was very courteous and I did just that. He also said call or use chat on their website to get back with customer service after sending and the agent would have access to the video and would view it and come up with a solution. I proceeded the next day to go into chat on their website and after finally connecting with an agent was told I would have to call to have the issue resolved.  So Alex was wrong about that. I called customer service and explained my problem and was told there was no attached video so I immediately sent another email which they got. Then this barrage of questions started while she was viewing the video asking if I adjusted the screw and of course it was evident in the video that I had and she thought she saw the dime move at which time I told her it could have been a quarter and not moved so she put me on hold so someone else could take a look at the video and then came back and asked if I had tried other positions with the screw and I said I had tried several positions in the half turn that was all the screw would move and that I had had a mixer that was this same model for several years so I knew what I was talking about. She finally said they would send me a replacement and that I was to send the defective one back.  This was clear cut from the beginning that I had a defective product but the agent had to insult my intelligence before admitting I had a defective mixer. I will most likely avoid Kitchenaid products in the future.  User's recommendation: If you get a good one out of the box the first time great but if you have to contact customer service prepare to have your intelligence insulted.

                I purchased the most expensive French door refrigerator kitchenmaid had three years ago. After a month I called them to say the ice maker was taking a week and a half to fill the bin. They came out and looked at it and said that's the way it is so I had to go purchase an ice making machine. All off my kitchen appliances are kitchenaid. Four thousand dollars for this product that will not make ice! Don't buy kitchenaid! They will not help you if something goes wrong.

                We purchased a $4000 refrigerator thinking it would be top of the line.  The ice maker broke a few months ago, we called for service and it was temporarily fixed. It broke again and we called for service once again, this time, the service person never showed up.  When I called to see what went on and to reschedule, I was advised that they had tried to call to let me know that no one was available and that I should not have waited for them to show.  The thing is, my cell records all calls answered or not, no call ever came from them.  In fact, I received an email on the day they claim to have called, the email was to confirm the appointment.  The item is not dependable and the customer service is much below what I had expected.

                Honestly, does any one really rave about Kitchenaide quality.  The only thing amazing with satin black fridge and stove is the look.  The slide in ceramic top stove use is dismal.  Slow heating elements makes it frustrating.  Coming from a coil electric stove this is just disappointing.  Yeah, it is easier to clean ( sort of) but use is frustrating.  Why should one have to wait so long for the element to heat up and get ready.  The touch screen is not easier.  What’s wrong with dials that one can’t reset by accident.  Fridge looks great but space inside is less.  So much is taken up with the water/ice making portion that the vegg and fruit boxes are way too small.  The interior is 80% plastic that won’t last.  The interior temp. Set at 38 freezes stuff on the top shelf.  Go figure. The only appliance of the set of three I spent more than $5000 for that is worthy of praise is the dishwasher.  Definitely will not buy another thing with Kitchenaide written on it.

                We purchased a $4000 refrigerator thinking it would be top of the line.  The ice maker broke a few months ago, we called for service and it was temporarily fixed. It broke again and we called for service once again, this time, the service person never showed up.  When I called to see what went on and to reschedule, I was advised that they had tried to call to let me know that no one was available and that I should not have waited for them to show.  The thing is, my cell records all calls answered or not, no call ever came from them.  In fact, I received an email on the day they claim to have called, the email was to confirm the appointment.  The item is not dependable and the customer service is much below what I had expected.

                I have just been onto Kitchen Aid  Customer Service UK with regard to a small repair to my Very expensive Artisan kettle. I was informed that they DO NOT repair small electrical goods that ARE OUT OF WARRANTY. Not bad for a company that has just been voted top 3 in best toasters that cannot be repaired!!!!!!!! My advise Is ask before buying a Kitchen Aid small electric appliance where to get it repaired better still buy a cheaper one and throw it away when broken. Vivienne

                I purchased a KitchenAid kettle from John Lewis &amp; Partners. The product looks good. However, I tried to register my product for warrantee (3 years on this product) but their standard form does not accept my postcode. I tried with and without space in between the letters and characters. So I decided to call customer services UK. All I achieved with this call was pressing buttons for this and that service which took 6 minutes, then I was given different phone numbers for different services and the robot just hang up. This is not customer service but a waste of customer time without any result. For goodness sake change your non-functional form to allow customers to register our products.

Kitchenaid corporate customer service is no help, courteous enough, but they cannot or will not help.  It's obviously a lemon but unless you want to bring kitchenaid into court you have no recourse but the throw the thing into a landfill and never ever buy kitchenaid and warn as many friends as possible and write reviews to help someone avoid this debacle ... UNBELIEVABLE...

Reached out 2 weeks later, they said the order got ""stuck"" in the system and that they would push it through. Another 2 weeks passed, still no delivery.

This order is not being processed. I am so sorry for the inconvenience. Is the charge still pending on your card?.... I am actually looking at the stock on that pan. It appears to be a discontinued item.""   Me: ""The last chat they told me it was stuck in the system but that she would push it through on January 17th... I know it's not your fault but is there any way this can be resolved more quickly? It was meant to be a gift for someone. I will take a look at my visa""  KitchenAid ""I am really sorry. They would not be able to push the order through if they do not have the item in stock. I believe that may be what happened. Is there anything else that I may assist you with right now?  Me: ""Yes, I did not receive an email or notification to advise the item was not in stock. I have a receipt confirmation email that the item was purchased.""

                I bought the 14 cup drip coffee pot with a full year warranty and have had to replaced it more then 5 times due to poor quality. They are now refusing to uphold their warranty to replace or refund. They want to give me a cheaper one that cost less then what I paid for. I'm planning on filing a consumer report complaint with the federal government. Everyone needs to do this so the agency will get involved with the quality of kitchenaid products. If we just post here, nothing will be done about their defective products and poor service. We MUST make them liable to stand behind their products. The consumer protection agency needs as many complaints as they can get before they start an investigation. DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH STEALING OUR MONEY.

                We have had a kitchenAid KSRT25CRSS01 refrigerator for 14 years. Over that time we have had 3 repairs that were needed. None too expensive. Biggest problem was water filter assembly leak which needed a replacement.  I want to describe the most recent problem which might be able to someone some money.  One day we noticed a puddle of water in the front left side of the refrigerator. Found out at the bottom of the freezer door there was a waterline elbow that was leaking. I thought it would be easy to find the part online and replace it. But I soon found out that this part is not on any of the parts diagrams. I searched multiple sites and spoke with reps who could not find it. Finally, I was able to identify that it was a Westinghouse 5/16” elbow. Then I was able to start getting prices. Unbelievably, the part sold anywhere from $10-$30 plus shipping! Not willing to pay that amount I contacted local plumbing supply shops. None of them carried the part. To make a longer story short, I finally found a part with that description online at a swimming pool parts supplier. If you need it, it was $1.79+shipping (gulp, was $6!). But for $8, I had the part delivered and it works fine. Here are the details: company: FreshWaterSystems.com. Part: John Guest Union Elbow Polypropylene 5/16. Good luck!

                I bought a Kitchenaid Professional 5 Mixer a year ago on 12/18. It is now 13 months later and the mixer broke. It will not turn on at times and it has developed a loud clunking sound when it runs. I contact Kitchen Aid about this and because it is 13 months old and only has a 1 year warranty, it is not covered. Save you money and buy a different brand, they do not make them like they use to.  Now I have to go return all the attachments I got for Christmas.

                Purchased a Kitchenaid Induction range         ( Model  YKIRS608BSS ) a few years ago and have had nothing but problems.  We became well acquainted with the service technicians during the first year as they were out constantly to replace the main control board. It was not successful but our warranty expired. I checked with the store and they said there were so many complaints that Kitchenaid issued a 'stop sell' on this model. After sending a scathing email to Kitchenaid,  they gave me another year of warranty.  They came out again with another board but still crap. What good is warranty if they can't fix an obviously faulty design. It's not rocket science as induction has been in use for years in Europe.  Avoid their large appliances like the plague, as they don't stand behind their products.

                We're in the midst of the worst customer service experience we've ever had. We purchased Kitchenaid's high end 42"" refrigerator and after using it only 6 mos it no longer works. It simply does not cool or freeze anything. The worst part is that this happened nearly six weeks ago and we are still waiting for the right 'specialist' to come and repair it. He would be the 3rd technician to come to our home and in each instance it has taken a week or more to get the next person scheduled. This is all happening throughout the holiday season, so we've had no refrigeration since mid-December and now into the 2nd week of the new year. No one at Kitchenaid will prioritize or escalate things on our behalf and each time I call we are on hold an increbily long time, on today's call it was 55mins - unfortunately that's not unusual. So we've lost the entire contents of the frig &amp; freezer and have been living out of a cooler in the garage throughout the entire holidays but that doesn't seem to be any concern to Kitchenaid. $7500 for a refrigerator and now waiting 6 weeks for the ""right"" technician to repair it, if that's even possible. Do yourself a favor and stay way from KItchenaid.

                On Christmas day we realized there was something wrong with our KA refrigerator because we had no ice and the freezer was above the correct temperature.  On New Years eve the repairman came out and told us the compressor had gone out.  A $1500. repair on a $3200. machine.  Thank goodness we took out an extended warranty.  Very disappointed with this refrigerator.  All of my appliances are KA and have always been pleased with them.  Next time I will think twice about buying KA

                I bought a Kitchenaid mixer with stand. It came with a notice stating if you register your product, you get 25% off your first attachment purchase.  The fine print says Offer available on purchase of select attachments made from official KitchenAid website only, excludes some model numbers (lists them). I registered and didn't know how to get 25% off so I went to the online chat at which time the person said I had to phone and that was better anyway because the phone service had better details than the website. I wanted to buy the food processor attachment which is on sale for $199 online (plus the 25% coupon I wanted to use). The phone person told me I can't order online, I must order via phone.  Her price was $229 and then I could get 25% off. Her Manager said the same. I pointed out Kitchenaid is one company so why do they have 2 prices and the flyer that came with my mixer said to order online but I needed a code.  They refused to provide a code and said my only option was the more expensive option. This is false advertising and Kitchenaid is untrustworthy.

My daughter bought a knife block for me for Christmas on-line.  I received an email notification. 2 days later, I received another email advising it was cancelled which I forwarded to my daughter.  She was informed that when the purchaser and receiver of the item is not the same person, their system will automatically cancel the order. Hello, that is what people do at Christmas all over the world. The company however did not return the money to my daughter.  It has been a month since she first ordered it and she still hasnt received her money back.  On top of that, their customer service employees accuse her of trying to scam the company. How on earth this company is still around I fail to understand.  Shame on you Kitchenaid and whirlpool for being untrustworthy yourselves.  You website guarantees a 7-10 day turnaround for refunds.

                I had such a horrible experience ordering through kitchenaid  It has now been over a month and I'm hoping things get settled properly because I do not want to call in again.   On nov 25th I placed an order for a knife block set for my mom for christmas. On nov 27th I checked my acct and the money was taken out and then I recieved an email from my mom which stated that the order was cancelled. So I called customer service and they stated that since it was shipped to one name but paid by another their system cancels it in case its fraud. Ok no problem.   The guy asks if I want to re purchase it but put it in my name, i said yes. The guy tells me that it's actually going to be cheaper cause there was an extra 20% off for that day. Perfect! Well some how it came out to $.50 more. I said whatever just place the order it's only $.50. A couple days later I check my acct and the money's been taken out but now it $6 more than what I was supposed to pay.....   so I call in again and i get the same guy. He apologizes and sends me out a cheque for $10 because they cant go any less than that. Sweet!   Just over a week goes by and neither myself nor my mom recieve any emails regarding this purchase so I ordered her a different set (different brand) at canadian tire which she picked up the next day and told her if the kitchen aid one shows up to send it back.   My mom arrives home one day to find the package at her door because another person living in her building let the purolator guy in so she couldn't just refuse the package. So she looks for a form that we were told would be with it to return it, there was no form. So my mom takes it back to purolator and they said no problem they have done this before and they ship it back. I gave it a while to ensure that the package would be delivered back til I called in to inquire about my refund. The woman told me that we did it wrong and that we needed them to mail us out a form to return it.... well the guy i talked to and their website say different!   I then had to call purolator to find out the tracking number and was pretty much called a liar when I explained how things were done, then she laughs at me and says she cant give me a refund.... I asked how I would find the tracking of this package not a refund.... wow.... my mom then has to go to purolator and gets it all sorted. *note: this was the day before new years eve. So I decide to wait til I am able to call in to kitchen aid again which was this morning.   I give all the information and am excited to be done with this month long ordeal. Well the woman comes back and says that since they sent that cheque (which I never cashed) they can only give me a credit. I dont want a credit. I want nothing to do with kitchen aid at this moment so no I will rip the cheque up, send it back or take a photo of it with void written on  it and email it to them. I just want my money back. I was placed on hold many times for long periods of time to finally hear I will be getting my money back but first the woman has to try and belittle me a bit like I'm trying to scam them for $10. Somehow in their minds I'm coming out on top.... ummm no I just want my money back and I will tear up the cheque thanks....   Now I have to wait a month or more to see the refund on my acct.... let's hope this is true....

I tried googling how to remove from the base and it wouldn’t budge.  On YouTube a reviewer said to place it on the floor and straddle it and turn the bowl.  Lol!!!!   I actually tried this and every possible other maneuver and it wouldn’t come off the base.  Then I put it on the counter and tried removing it again the normal way  and it fell off the counter and the glass bowl had broken.  Sadly, I had to order a stainless bowl and I will never ever buy a glass bowl to be used with a mixer.  It doesn’t seem safe anyway.  Long story short the kitchen aid does have a great motor and design aesthetic however the glass bowl shouldn’t be used.  The quality is great otherwise!

                I recently ordered a KitchenAid mixer as a gift.  Since the gift was not for someone in my immediate family, my billing address and my shipping addresses were different.  The website actually offers to have you buy a product as a gift, and since many gifts are purchased for people who do not live at my address, it never occurred to me that it would not be possible to pay for a product and have it sent to it's recipient at a different address.  Apparently, for Kitchenaid, this circumstance is one of several that will bump your order into a ""possibly fraudulent situation"" that will put your order on an indefinite hold.  I was sent a generic email five days after placing the order that said my order was not shipped and would not ship until further notice and there was no way to tell when or if this order would be filled.   It didn't indicate my name or order number or product ordered.  I called Kitchenaid directly and was put on hold for 38 minutes.  When a customer service representative answered, she could not give me any information other than the same information in the email -- that yes, I had placed an order but there was no way to tell where the product was or when or if it could be delivered.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The customer service supervisor explained that our order had been sent to their fraud department for one of many reasons.  Our order could have contained an incorrectly spelled name, or we could have entered a zip code incorrectly or ""any number of reasons"" but no reason that could be specifically attached to our order.  Further, the fraud department was not reachable on the phone, ever, nor could she talk to them and she didn't know when or if she ever would be able to speak to them.  Our only recourse was to wait for another generically sent email that would explain that our order was either sent through or cancelled.  The fraud department would have made their decision within 24 to 48 hours but the email of explanation would take up to four days.  At this point, it has been five days.  One of my biggest problems is that the customer service representatives were unhelpful, unable to confirm or explain what was going on with the order and, although the company said they hadn't charged my card, they actually have.  The money is out of my account and I have no product and no order delivery time or date.  It has been explained to me by customer service that I could be a scammer, she used those words exactly, and that all of this vague information was for my protection.  This is ridiculously poor customer service.  I  should be able to expect a company that has taken funds from my account to be able to tell me where the product I purchased is and when it will arrive.  I went through three phone calls and three people before finally cancelling my order.  The last person I spoke with was able to explain the order process and where our order seemed to have been delayed.  She did suggest cancelling the order and beginning again at a somewhat later date.  Apparently engraving (which we had ordered on our Kitchenaid mixer) is not always available, so if we wait to re-order, engraving might not be available.  Honestly, I would order through a third party company with reliable and good customer service.  We, literally, spent three hours on the phone, most of it on hold, in order to cancel an order that was placed five days ago.  Considering how much commerce happens on the internet, Kitchenaid needs to up their game considerably.

This is the fun part every year after year for 4 years now fridge goes warm and it ices inside . Called the manufacturer and they do nothing for you . Last visit from the repair people was 500.00 dollars. So my suggestion to anyone in the market for a fridge be aware.

                Do not buy if you think about service and warranty. I got it and had issued from the first month. I neglect to report it timely. I rented my house and my tenant started using it. They had the same problem. We called the service. They said there was a delay receiving hot water: we need to reset it. They charged me $120. In two weeks this time, they said motor is faulty and it is out of warranty. I decided to get rid of it and purchased a new dishwasher. They did not responded positively. I even told them to come and check if the machine has factory faulty. They said no. DO NOT BUY IT. I had a much better warranty experience with other companies.

                It is my first and last experience with KitchenAid. The order had been made on CyberMonday as a gift for Christmas to good friend. Amount had been charged from my CC, and in a week I receive an email from KitchenAid.com that my order is canceled. Link to order is not working, their site is under maintenance. There is NO way to reach Customer Service for order status. Horrible experience!!

                My wife finally decided to spend the money on an Artisan mixer. It came without the fill spout in the box. So I called the customer service number and was told the wait time was 39 minutes. Thinking this isn’t possible, I stayed on hold. After about 10 minutes I was told the wait time is still 33 minutes. I opted to use there email instead as I did not have time to sit on hold. I received a response that I would be contacted within 2 business days. After 3 go by with no communication, I call again. This time the wait was 11 minutes. I finally get a person and it was a harder process than expected.  Apparently someone else was registered with my phone number. We moved a year ago so maybe the old owner of our number did register. Understandable. But it confused the lady on the phone. She finally put me on hold for a while to look into something. When she returned, she took my information and they are supposed to be sending the part. We will see as it can take up to 10 business days. Which is also confusing as I could have just returned the unit as damaged instead of trying to save them the headache.

                I have a double Kitchen Aid oven and cook every day. Lower oven light bulb went out and when it was replaced it blew out all bulbs.  The repair man told me that the electric panel would need to be replaced , costing more than $1,000 and that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new oven.  Bear in mind that the ovens work perfectly, but what a joke and a rip off to need to spend over $1,000 to have lights in the ovens.   I would never buy another appliance from Kitchen Aid.

                I purchased 3 major kitchen aide products during my kitchen remodel. I was encouraged to purchase these products because of a rebate kitchen aide was offering. 4 months later I still have no rebate and was told that although the items were purchased during the promotional period and paid for the delivered invoice was after the promotional period. If anyone has done a kitchen remodel you would know that installation can be delayed. I spent 8,000 on my appliances and Kitchen Aide will not pay me my 250$ rebate. I will never purchase another item from them again and will make sure I tell everyone I know what has happened . Very disappointed in this company

                Built a home 3 years ago and the builder put in Kitchen aid appliances.   First, the dishwasher doesn't dry ANYTHING!!!! The side vents are fake and the service guy admitted the product sucks ... HUH!?  Second, the fridge has a two doors, and one of them has a sealing panel attached to it, and when you open and close that door the other should close, but it doesn't, so unless you know this and close the other door two you wake up to pools of water on the floor and a half melted fridge!!! UGH!  Third, I was stupid enough to buy 3 under the counter fridges for wine, cocktail mixes, etc. HUGE mistake. After the first year one fo them had the=digtail control panel come UNGLUED!!! YES, THEY USE GLUE!!! After arguing with the service center they repaired it for free.  Guess what I just noticed? The second ones digital panel came unglued and the wine went bad.. smells horrible. Once again had to escalate the issue to Care Resolutoin and they said we will pay for the $5 part but I have to p[ay for service call... really? It's a completely flawed design with GLUE! And I'm sure the 3rd one will eventually lose it's tackiness. I'm mad as a hornet! 4 refrigerates that suck.. all for the low low price of $6,400!!! I'm such a sucker.. I HOPE YOU WON'T BE!!

                I chose to buy a Kitchenaid Dishwasher after my Maytag failed after 6.5 years.The dry cycle worked sporadically on the Maytag starting in year 5.On the brand new top of the line Kitchenaid it didnt work for a second.The dishwasher completed the cycle leaving the plates wet and utensils just wet.After emptying the dishwasher it remained wet and musty.Two weeks later the technician arrived to check why the Disheasher was not working.Surprise Surprise the 2 week old dishwasher needs a new motherboard I called Whirlpool..I told them I wasnt comfortable with a brand new dishwasher that needed major repair after 2 weeks..The Supervisor said if I didnt want the repairs offered she could help me by canceling the repair order as well..If you have never purchased a Kitchenaid Appliance dont..Lack of service and professionalism has been my first experience with them  .

                Bad. So bad. I attempted to order a stand mixer - placed the order, received the confirmation, saw the pending charge on my credit card, and then received an email that my order had been cancelled. I called to figure out the problem and they said it was because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I replaced the order over the phone, but never received a confirmation. The original charge was still pending on my credit card but the new purchase never showed up. I contacted KitchenAid and their representative said that the order had been cancelled because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I explained that this had happened before, and that I placed the order over the phone to make sure it didn't happen again and they said they didn't know what was wrong but their system didn't accept the order. I placed it AGAIN. The old charge was removed from my credit card, the new charge showed up as pending. I never received a confirmation of the order. A week later, after following up via email twice without response, the order showed up at my BILLING ADDRESS which I actively avoid shipping to because packages often get stolen.  Luckily this was not stolen but I will never order from KitchenAid again.

                I had such a horrible experience ordering through kitchenaid  It has now been over a month and I'm hoping things get settled properly because I do not want to call in again.   On nov 25th I placed an order for a knife block set for my mom for christmas. On nov 27th I checked my acct and the money was taken out and then I recieved an email from my mom which stated that the order was cancelled. So I called customer service and they stated that since it was shipped to one name but paid by another their system cancels it in case its fraud. Ok no problem.   The guy asks if I want to re purchase it but put it in my name, i said yes. The guy tells me that it's actually going to be cheaper cause there was an extra 20% off for that day. Perfect! Well some how it came out to $.50 more. I said whatever just place the order it's only $.50. A couple days later I check my acct and the money's been taken out but now it $6 more than what I was supposed to pay.....   so I call in again and i get the same guy. He apologizes and sends me out a cheque for $10 because they cant go any less than that. Sweet!   Just over a week goes by and neither myself nor my mom recieve any emails regarding this purchase so I ordered her a different set (different brand) at canadian tire which she picked up the next day and told her if the kitchen aid one shows up to send it back.   My mom arrives home one day to find the package at her door because another person living in her building let the purolator guy in so she couldn't just refuse the package. So she looks for a form that we were told would be with it to return it, there was no form. So my mom takes it back to purolator and they said no problem they have done this before and they ship it back. I gave it a while to ensure that the package would be delivered back til I called in to inquire about my refund. The woman told me that we did it wrong and that we needed them to mail us out a form to return it.... well the guy i talked to and their website say different!   I then had to call purolator to find out the tracking number and was pretty much called a liar when I explained how things were done, then she laughs at me and says she cant give me a refund.... I asked how I would find the tracking of this package not a refund.... wow.... my mom then has to go to purolator and gets it all sorted. *note: this was the day before new years eve. So I decide to wait til I am able to call in to kitchen aid again which was this morning.   I give all the information and am excited to be done with this month long ordeal. Well the woman comes back and says that since they sent that cheque (which I never cashed) they can only give me a credit. I dont want a credit. I want nothing to do with kitchen aid at this moment so no I will rip the cheque up, send it back or take a photo of it with void written on  it and email it to them. I just want my money back. I was placed on hold many times for long periods of time to finally hear I will be getting my money back but first the woman has to try and belittle me a bit like I'm trying to scam them for $10. Somehow in their minds I'm coming out on top.... ummm no I just want my money back and I will tear up the cheque thanks....   Now I have to wait a month or more to see the refund on my acct.... let's hope this is true....

                I was so excited to get the beautiful kitchen aid mixer with glass bowl.  When I was mixing dough it made the glass bowl lock itself to the base.  I tried googling how to remove from the base and it wouldn’t budge.  On YouTube a reviewer said to place it on the floor and straddle it and turn the bowl.  Lol!!!!   I actually tried this and every possible other maneuver and it wouldn’t come off the base.  Then I put it on the counter and tried removing it again the normal way  and it fell off the counter and the glass bowl had broken.  Sadly, I had to order a stainless bowl and I will never ever buy a glass bowl to be used with a mixer.  It doesn’t seem safe anyway.  Long story short the kitchen aid does have a great motor and design aesthetic however the glass bowl shouldn’t be used.  The quality is great otherwise!

                I ordered a mixer, and the order is being held up as possibly fraudulent. They won't say when it will be resolved. I see that somebody below has the exact same problem. If anyone is fraudulent, it's KitchenAid.com.

                I recently ordered a KitchenAid mixer as a gift.  Since the gift was not for someone in my immediate family, my billing address and my shipping addresses were different.  The website actually offers to have you buy a product as a gift, and since many gifts are purchased for people who do not live at my address, it never occurred to me that it would not be possible to pay for a product and have it sent to it's recipient at a different address.  Apparently, for Kitchenaid, this circumstance is one of several that will bump your order into a ""possibly fraudulent situation"" that will put your order on an indefinite hold.  I was sent a generic email five days after placing the order that said my order was not shipped and would not ship until further notice and there was no way to tell when or if this order would be filled.   It didn't indicate my name or order number or product ordered.  I called Kitchenaid directly and was put on hold for 38 minutes.  When a customer service representative answered, she could not give me any information other than the same information in the email -- that yes, I had placed an order but there was no way to tell where the product was or when or if it could be delivered.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The customer service supervisor explained that our order had been sent to their fraud department for one of many reasons.  Our order could have contained an incorrectly spelled name, or we could have entered a zip code incorrectly or ""any number of reasons"" but no reason that could be specifically attached to our order.  Further, the fraud department was not reachable on the phone, ever, nor could she talk to them and she didn't know when or if she ever would be able to speak to them.  Our only recourse was to wait for another generically sent email that would explain that our order was either sent through or cancelled.  The fraud department would have made their decision within 24 to 48 hours but the email of explanation would take up to four days.  At this point, it has been five days.  One of my biggest problems is that the customer service representatives were unhelpful, unable to confirm or explain what was going on with the order and, although the company said they hadn't charged my card, they actually have.  The money is out of my account and I have no product and no order delivery time or date.  It has been explained to me by customer service that I could be a scammer, she used those words exactly, and that all of this vague information was for my protection.  This is ridiculously poor customer service.  I  should be able to expect a company that has taken funds from my account to be able to tell me where the product I purchased is and when it will arrive.  I went through three phone calls and three people before finally cancelling my order.  The last person I spoke with was able to explain the order process and where our order seemed to have been delayed.  She did suggest cancelling the order and beginning again at a somewhat later date.  Apparently engraving (which we had ordered on our Kitchenaid mixer) is not always available, so if we wait to re-order, engraving might not be available.  Honestly, I would order through a third party company with reliable and good customer service.  We, literally, spent three hours on the phone, most of it on hold, in order to cancel an order that was placed five days ago.  Considering how much commerce happens on the internet, Kitchenaid needs to up their game considerably.

                I bought my wife a professional 5 plus mixer last Christmas.  She has used it 6 times this year.  She is now baking for Christmas and paint is mixed in the cookies.  My mother had the same issue except hers was 20 years old.   Do I have to buy a new flat beater every 5th use?   What a cheap product.

                We purchased a new Kitchen Aid fridge within a year and a half had two repairs done . Finally the company we purchased the fridge from gave us a new one . This is the fun part every year after year for 4 years now fridge goes warm and it ices inside . Called the manufacturer and they do nothing for you . Last visit from the repair people was 500.00 dollars. So my suggestion to anyone in the market for a fridge be aware.

                Do not buy if you think about service and warranty. I got it and had issued from the first month. I neglect to report it timely. I rented my house and my tenant started using it. They had the same problem. We called the service. They said there was a delay receiving hot water: we need to reset it. They charged me $120. In two weeks this time, they said motor is faulty and it is out of warranty. I decided to get rid of it and purchased a new dishwasher. They did not responded positively. I even told them to come and check if the machine has factory faulty. They said no. DO NOT BUY IT. I had a much better warranty experience with other companies.

And I'm sure the 3rd one will eventually lose it's tackiness. I'm mad as a hornet! 4 refrigerates that suck.. all for the low low price of $6,400!!! I'm such a sucker.. I HOPE YOU WON'T BE!! STAY AWAY FROM ALL KITEHCN AID CRAP!

                I chose to buy a Kitchenaid Dishwasher after my Maytag failed after 6.5 years.The dry cycle worked sporadically on the Maytag starting in year 5.On the brand new top of the line Kitchenaid it didnt work for a second.The dishwasher completed the cycle leaving the plates wet and utensils just wet.After emptying the dishwasher it remained wet and musty.Two weeks later the technician arrived to check why the Disheasher was not working.Surprise Surprise the 2 week old dishwasher needs a new motherboard I called Whirlpool..I told them I wasnt comfortable with a brand new dishwasher that needed major repair after 2 weeks..The Supervisor said if I didnt want the repairs offered she could help me by canceling the repair order as well..If you have never purchased a Kitchenaid Appliance dont..Lack of service and professionalism has been my first experience with them  .

                Bad. So bad. I attempted to order a stand mixer - placed the order, received the confirmation, saw the pending charge on my credit card, and then received an email that my order had been cancelled. I called to figure out the problem and they said it was because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I replaced the order over the phone, but never received a confirmation. The original charge was still pending on my credit card but the new purchase never showed up. I contacted KitchenAid and their representative said that the order had been cancelled because my billing and shipping addresses were different. I explained that this had happened before, and that I placed the order over the phone to make sure it didn't happen again and they said they didn't know what was wrong but their system didn't accept the order. I placed it AGAIN. The old charge was removed from my credit card, the new charge showed up as pending. I never received a confirmation of the order. A week later, after following up via email twice without response, the order showed up at my BILLING ADDRESS which I actively avoid shipping to because packages often get stolen.  Luckily this was not stolen but I will never order from KitchenAid again.

  AVOID these cowboys. Tried to buy a webcam direct from Logitech.com. Quickly got an email confirming my order and confirmation from PayPal that they'd taken my money (£99). Then silence. The webcam was in stock when ordered, so a week later I was wondering why it hadn't arrived. So I sent messages to Logitech and to Digital River, their agent. No response. Rang Digital River twice, they apparently could see my order but were, and I quote 'not allowed to get involved in Logitech stuff'. Finally after a long search I found a number for Logitech in the UK and got through to a guy who could help. He told me that my order was at least 2 weeks away from being shipped, and that was not guaranteed. Likely if anything to be longer. I pointed out that I'd ordered the item as in stock and my money had been taken. No explanation. So I've had to cancel my order and buy a different product. Well done Logitech. AVOID these cowboys.

  Great Marketing Terrible Products Awful Customer Service Non-Existent Technical Support ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have purchased a total of 3 mouses from Logitech. Yes, 3 mouses! I have spent 300 euros in total. I bought the MX Master 2 for myself and was very happy. So I bought a second 1 for my father as well. After a while, my MX Maters 2 started to act out to a point where it very negatively impacted my work. I tried everything I could. Reinstalling their software multiple times, reinstalling my Mac software, etc. After a while, I got so frustrated with the mouse that I just threw it in the garbage and bought a new one, the MX Master 3. I just received it a couple weeks ago, connected it to my iMac and started working. After about 2 hours of work, the mouse has decided not to work out of nowhere. I have reinstalled the software, restarted my computer and it simply wasn't working. I have contacted their support over the phone, they barely spoke English and then transferred me to a number that wasn't working. Then, I decided to create a ticket through their website. I waited a week just to be told that I should go on their website and look for their FAQ section to resolve my issue. Are you kidding? 1 week to tell me that? I also tried contacting them over Facebook live chat and was told to submit a ticket. It's been over two weeks since I bought my third mouse and it's still not working. No one at Logitech seems to care to help their clients.  Logitech: If I wanted a cheap mouse, I would spend 5 euros on Amazon.

  Worst customer service ever..... Purchased a keyboard from Logitech.com. 48 hours later there was no confirmation email or acknowledgement of the order yet they'd certainly taken my money! I used their 'findmyorder' system to check for an order associated with my email address but 'No Order Found' was returned to me. Decided to submit an enquiry through the logitech website, received a confirmation email from a random company called Digital River which made no reference to Logitech at all yet the timing seemed coincidental so assumed it must have been them. 48 hours later, still no response. Followed up by replying to the Digital River email only to be told they cannot help me as they are simply a reseller??? Why are you the point of contact for customer service then? I then found another way of contacting Logitech only to be sent to an outsourced offshore support team. They take 3 business days to reply to any message and must not actually read any of my messages so no progress is ever made. After a few days of all this I ordered my keyboard from a different company and received it within 24 hours. I told Logitech not to bother sending the keyboard as i'd purchased elsewhere and they finally agreed to cancel the order. The funds were returned from my card... happy days. or so I thought! Then 2 days later I receive a tracking number for a delivery from Logitech! I check my bank balance and they had re-debited the order! What the? That was over a week ago... now I have two keyboards and no matter what I do am unable to organise a return with Logitech as the support staff continually ignore the request. The returns form on their website also does not work as it says my order number is not found! Literally at a loss of where to turn now... massively disappointed with a company that makes such great products. Sort yourselves out otherwise no quality product will save you.

  MK550 keyboard and Mouse Combo 1) I am on my second K350 Wireless keyboard from this combo and it will be the last. Main problems is the printing on the keys wears off and there is NO replacement, from Logitech. After market stickers do not last very well. These characters should be permanent. In this day of cast/moulded characters, this is simple unacceptable. 2) Absolutely hideous SetPoint software. Supposed to show BUNDLED M510 mouse tab but not there. Unifying Software can see it clearly.. Prog tells me to install Options.. which i do and it does absolutely SFA. Try reinstalling etc in the usual way but still stubbornly refuses to do anything. Logitech have had years to get their act together and no doubt countless people complain AFTER buying their rubbish, so why would they bother? This is both absurd and unacceptable. What is wrong with these people? Their dominance of the market has made them lazy and disrespectful of their customers. 1 star because 0 is not possible.

  Well I can only say their customer service is very poor, they don't reply back to your emails, no landline no nothing. I have an issue with my powerplay, is not charging anymore so I contacted via website support. Someone replied back to me saying to give them serial number, done and dusted. After few days the same person is asking me to destroy my powerplay so I can get a replacement as the old one is not working anymore. Ok, destroyed my powerplay and uploaded the video on youtube as their request and is been accepted as a proof. After 2 weeks the same person is telling me customer service department will email me with tracking number soon, they actually done it after 5 days so in total almost 1 month. All good and nicely, they finally email me, the actual parcel is coming and I was straight away shocked with the size of the parcel (remember when I bought my powerplay it was a massive box) but guess what, this one was a tiny little box. Opened the box, received a cable instead by mistake. Took some pictures with what I received and emailed back logi support. Again, the same person is replying back (that was last week) saying they will have to review it internally and get back to me. Since last week no one replied back to me. So now basically I have a powerplay unit in pieces which can't be used anymore, their department is not even bothered replying to your problems but yes they want money for theirs expensive products!!!

  I purchased a headset that broke after 2 months. I have been dealing with their customer support and after 2 weeks responding to me they now say I have to be switched to the gaming dept which they will not respond.

I have never did a review with anyone that was negative but think twice before you buy a Logitech item cause they do not warrant their products.

  Don't bother ordering. They don't seem to have stuff in stock despite saying that they do; they don't despatch when the say they will; they take your money as soon as you order not when shipped even tho their website says they don't; they currently have no phone customer care; their online customer support is totally unacceptable as they don't read your emails but merely reply with information that it already on their website; they ignore your request to cancel an order. Woeful doesn't come close. Truly dreadful

  Placed and order on the 27th April for the silver MX Master mouse. Within 30mins I change my mind and tried to change the order to the black version.  Firstly, there was no option to amend the order. Then I tried to contact the customer service online and by email. I got no response. I then called the number provided. The first two calls I spoke to Vincent, who quickly muted my call and left me waiting for over 5mins each time.  I then while on hold I rang with a different phone. Spoke with a woman this time. The connection was suspiciously ""faulty"" and kept cutting in and out. I eventually, communicated that I would like to change the colour of the order or cancel it. The woman confirmed they would cancel the order and told me to look out for the cancellation email. I received an email from Vincent stating they would cancel the order if I replied with the details. I did this straight away. I never got a confirmation email despite requesting one several times.  Today 30th April, I have got a confirmation of shipment email, despite all of my attempts to cancel the order.  I am very annoyed as it says in their terms and conditions that the customer is responsible for paying for Returns shipping cost.

  Never posted a review like this before. I bought a €250 webcam which was advertised on the logitech site as in stock. It wasn't so I bought elsewhere - but Logitech would not allow me to cancel the item, even though it had not shipped. Then once delivered their customer service would not issue any instructions on how to return the unopened product. I have been trying for 2 weeks to get a response. I have never experienced anything like this.

  This is probably the worst customer support I've had to deal with, EVER. First of all they don't pick up. I was on hold for roughly 45 minutes before getting to anyone. Then the lady put me on hold to figure out how to help and the call got disconnected on their side. Of course when I called back had to wait again which I didn't have time for. So the next day I'm still trying to reach someone. As soon as they answer the phone and say hi, the phone goes silent and I can't hear anything. I think this is just a tactic not to speak to their customers. This is just not fair!!!

  Great Marketing Terrible Products Awful Customer Service Non-Existent Technical Support ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have purchased a total of 3 mouses from Logitech. Yes, 3 mouses! I have spent 300 euros in total. I bought the MX Master 2 for myself and was very happy. So I bought a second 1 for my father as well. After a while, my MX Maters 2 started to act out to a point where it very negatively impacted my work. I tried everything I could. Reinstalling their software multiple times, reinstalling my Mac software, etc. After a while, I got so frustrated with the mouse that I just threw it in the garbage and bought a new one, the MX Master 3. I just received it a couple weeks ago, connected it to my iMac and started working. After about 2 hours of work, the mouse has decided not to work out of nowhere. I have reinstalled the software, restarted my computer and it simply wasn't working. I have contacted their support over the phone, they barely spoke English and then transferred me to a number that wasn't working. Then, I decided to create a ticket through their website. I waited a week just to be told that I should go on their website and look for their FAQ section to resolve my issue. Are you kidding? 1 week to tell me that? I also tried contacting them over Facebook live chat and was told to submit a ticket. It's been over two weeks since I bought my third mouse and it's still not working. No one at Logitech seems to care to help their clients.  Logitech: If I wanted a cheap mouse, I would spend 5 euros on Amazon.

  Worst customer service ever..... Purchased a keyboard from Logitech.com. 48 hours later there was no confirmation email or acknowledgement of the order yet they'd certainly taken my money! I used their 'findmyorder' system to check for an order associated with my email address but 'No Order Found' was returned to me. Decided to submit an enquiry through the logitech website, received a confirmation email from a random company called Digital River which made no reference to Logitech at all yet the timing seemed coincidental so assumed it must have been them. 48 hours later, still no response. Followed up by replying to the Digital River email only to be told they cannot help me as they are simply a reseller??? Why are you the point of contact for customer service then? I then found another way of contacting Logitech only to be sent to an outsourced offshore support team. They take 3 business days to reply to any message and must not actually read any of my messages so no progress is ever made. After a few days of all this I ordered my keyboard from a different company and received it within 24 hours. I told Logitech not to bother sending the keyboard as i'd purchased elsewhere and they finally agreed to cancel the order. The funds were returned from my card... happy days. or so I thought! Then 2 days later I receive a tracking number for a delivery from Logitech! I check my bank balance and they had re-debited the order! What the? That was over a week ago... now I have two keyboards and no matter what I do am unable to organise a return with Logitech as the support staff continually ignore the request. The returns form on their website also does not work as it says my order number is not found! Literally at a loss of where to turn now... massively disappointed with a company that makes such great products. Sort yourselves out otherwise no quality product will save you.

  MK550 keyboard and Mouse Combo 1) I am on my second K350 Wireless keyboard from this combo and it will be the last. Main problems is the printing on the keys wears off and there is NO replacement, from Logitech. After market stickers do not last very well. These characters should be permanent. In this day of cast/moulded characters, this is simple unacceptable. 2) Absolutely hideous SetPoint software. Supposed to show BUNDLED M510 mouse tab but not there. Unifying Software can see it clearly.. Prog tells me to install Options.. which i do and it does absolutely SFA. Try reinstalling etc in the usual way but still stubbornly refuses to do anything. Logitech have had years to get their act together and no doubt countless people complain AFTER buying their rubbish, so why would they bother? This is both absurd and unacceptable. What is wrong with these people? Their dominance of the market has made them lazy and disrespectful of their customers. 1 star because 0 is not possible.

  Well I can only say their customer service is very poor, they don't reply back to your emails, no landline no nothing. I have an issue with my powerplay, is not charging anymore so I contacted via website support. Someone replied back to me saying to give them serial number, done and dusted. After few days the same person is asking me to destroy my powerplay so I can get a replacement as the old one is not working anymore. Ok, destroyed my powerplay and uploaded the video on youtube as their request and is been accepted as a proof. After 2 weeks the same person is telling me customer service department will email me with tracking number soon, they actually done it after 5 days so in total almost 1 month. All good and nicely, they finally email me, the actual parcel is coming and I was straight away shocked with the size of the parcel (remember when I bought my powerplay it was a massive box) but guess what, this one was a tiny little box. Opened the box, received a cable instead by mistake. Took some pictures with what I received and emailed back logi support. Again, the same person is replying back (that was last week) saying they will have to review it internally and get back to me. Since last week no one replied back to me. So now basically I have a powerplay unit in pieces which can't be used anymore, their department is not even bothered replying to your problems but yes they want money for theirs expensive products!!!

Order not found on website yet Digital River have taken my money. Various messages sent via the website and social media all with no response. I know logistics are difficult at the moment but come on, none of the other companies that I have dealt with over the last month have been this bad. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.

  I purchased a headset that broke after 2 months. I have been dealing with their customer support and after 2 weeks responding to me they now say I have to be switched to the gaming dept which they will not respond. This is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I have never did a review with anyone that was negative but think twice before you buy a Logitech item cause they do not warrant their products.

  Don't bother ordering. They don't seem to have stuff in stock despite saying that they do; they don't despatch when the say they will; they take your money as soon as you order not when shipped even tho their website says they don't; they currently have no phone customer care; their online customer support is totally unacceptable as they don't read your emails but merely reply with information that it already on their website; they ignore your request to cancel an order. Woeful doesn't come close. Truly dreadful

  Placed and order on the 27th April for the silver MX Master mouse. Within 30mins I change my mind and tried to change the order to the black version.  Firstly, there was no option to amend the order. Then I tried to contact the customer service online and by email. I got no response. I then called the number provided. The first two calls I spoke to Vincent, who quickly muted my call and left me waiting for over 5mins each time.  I then while on hold I rang with a different phone. Spoke with a woman this time. The connection was suspiciously ""faulty"" and kept cutting in and out. I eventually, communicated that I would like to change the colour of the order or cancel it. The woman confirmed they would cancel the order and told me to look out for the cancellation email. I received an email from Vincent stating they would cancel the order if I replied with the details. I did this straight away. I never got a confirmation email despite requesting one several times.  Today 30th April, I have got a confirmation of shipment email, despite all of my attempts to cancel the order.  I am very annoyed as it says in their terms and conditions that the customer is responsible for paying for Returns shipping cost.

  Never posted a review like this before. I bought a €250 webcam which was advertised on the logitech site as in stock. It wasn't so I bought elsewhere - but Logitech would not allow me to cancel the item, even though it had not shipped. Then once delivered their customer service would not issue any instructions on how to return the unopened product. I have been trying for 2 weeks to get a response. I have never experienced anything like this.

  This is probably the worst customer support I've had to deal with, EVER. First of all they don't pick up. I was on hold for roughly 45 minutes before getting to anyone. Then the lady put me on hold to figure out how to help and the call got disconnected on their side. Of course when I called back had to wait again which I didn't have time for. So the next day I'm still trying to reach someone. As soon as they answer the phone and say hi, the phone goes silent and I can't hear anything. I think this is just a tactic not to speak to their customers. This is just not fair!!!

  Ordered a webcam, paid for express delivery and heard nothing for 2 weeks. Was pragmatic to think it might be CV19 related however when looking to try and find out information about the order status there is a lack of info and no customer service line to speak to someone about this. All the time they have taken my money when actually most companies take on dispatch. Tried to get the facebook messenger team to help but they were absolutely useless and kept referring me to product support. Useless! one of the worst customer journeys I have had!!!!

  I appreciate that Covid is causing issues, but if you have a website that says a webcam is in stock, accept my order and take my payment it seems reasonable to assume that I have made a valid purchase and can expect delivery. But after 2.5 weeks nothing - no webcam, no update on my account, no response from customer services, no email communication to me..... And I used to think that Logitech was a reputable business.

  MOUSE SHAPE in the WIRELESS COMBO—WINDOWS-CHROME The new Logitech mouse shares a hand design that is a proven Fail against others like GearHead. Its about the shape or grasp. This hourglass shape has the narrow place located in the middle of the mouse instead of where normal sized hands want to grasp—up near the nose of the mouse where the fingertip controls are located. I have a great pic to describe at a glance what is going on but I see not photo upload tool. New keyboard is perfect for a basic, which is what I wanted the most. Even includes minimal value added functions at the top that doesn't take up too much real estate which always robs from qwerty button structure. I can use or ignore them but find them useful, so thx for that Logi.  Wish I could use the mouse that came with. Wasted resources.

  Firstly it's worth mentioning that I didn't experience the delivery delay that others have had - the items were shipped 3 days after the order was placed. However, I initially made an order for a Logitech Stream Cam but very quickly changed my mind to spend a little more on a BRIO Stream - I called up Logitech support roughly 15 minutes after placing the Stream Cam order and explained that I would like to cancel the Stream Cam order - The woman on the phone said this should be fine, you can cancel any order up until it's been shipped. I checked a few times and order number no longer showed as existing, which led me to believe this had been cancelled - I've just received an e-mail saying ""unfortunately you didn't cancel this order in time, so we will still be charging you for the product"" - In what world is 15 minutes after placing an order ""not in time"" to cancel it? Logitech clearly states that you can cancel any orders up until they have been shipped. To put the cherry on top, I am unable to launch a refund/returns issue because the order number *still* doesn't show as existing - Meaning I will have to try my best to get in touch with them again and find out a solution.  I would strong recommend using an alternative company in the future - There is no reason in 2020 for a company to not have a simplified cancellation procedure or an easy contact route for returns/issues with order numbers.  Avoid Logitech.

  I used to use logitech exclusively. Everyone Knew their switches were a lottery, but they would replace their faulty device until you got a good one. Apparently they don't do that anymore. I've bought 3 of their mice in the past year, because I used to like supporting their company. I developed a double click on one, no problem I thought, I'll use another. It too got a double click a month later. So I emailed logitech, expecting their usual customer service... but then they asked me to try about 3 hours worth of troubleshooting. When that didn't work, they wanted me to take a video of me proving it didn't work. I'm done buying from this company. How you go from the best customer service immediately to the worst, is beyond me.

  Worst customer service ever... Headset broke... still in warranty so i emailed them. Took over a week for a reply and they asked for photo and proof of purchase. Supplied these.

  My story is the same as many others ordered an item that was showing in stock only to never arrive. I ordered a webcam on March 25th but it had still not arrived on April 6th I paid extra for express postage. The money was taken from my account the day after ordering by Digital River a company Logitech use to process the payment they have worst reviews than Logitech on Trust Pilot. It was lucky I used Paypal and opened a dispute for non-delivery and received a full refund yesterday. The customer service is diabolical the only contact I had from them was to tell me two weeks after I had ordered that your order will be another 3 weeks. If they had told me that I would have to wait 5 weeks for delivery would I have placed an order NO.

  Probably the worst customer experience I've ever had to deal with. They ask you to take pictures and answer tons of questions (because of course you are a liar and a bad customer for them), then if you're motivated enough to reach that stage, they just basically tell you that they can't do anything for you. This was litterally my experience with them.

  I ordered a webcam to make some telework at home, 15 days have passed from the order date, since then I have not received any information from them and my order still in ""process"". There is no way to communicate with them, they are not answering any call made by phone and you do not have any email to contact them.

  I have owned Logitech products since the early 90’s and every single one I’ve had has been a pleasure to own. I can’t recall ever having any issues with a Logitech product so I have never had to deal with their customer service or warranty and cannot speak for the quality of either. I have owned computer speakers, webcams, wired headsets, chargers and charging stations for iOS products, keyboards, mice, combinations of both keyboard and mice, and their Harmony remotes. I don’t know what else to say about them other than I believe the quality of the products they make are really good and durable, not cheaply made or flimsy. I am definitely “brand loyal” to anything Logitech.  The most recent item I purchased from them is the MX Master 3 mouse. The reason I went with this mouse was for two primary reasons. The first being the ability to use this mouse via Bluetooth between multiple computers even when the computers don’t share the same OS. That is working out very well for me and efficiently too. The second reason was for the ergonomics of the mouse itself and I have found this one to be very comfortable on the hand and the wrist. Some other things to note about the MX Master 3 is the battery life of the mouse is fantastic! I don’t have a hard number off the top of my head, but it lasts a few good months before needing a charge which is done by a USB-C cable included with the mouse. Also, the buttons. There are a perfect amount of buttons which you can program to take care of different functions. Some that you probably didn’t even know was possible, which I actually discovered after purchasing the mouse. I didn’t realize it has an app that could be used to program them for different uses.

  I would never have thought that a company as well know as Logitech would be so dishonest and provide such bad customer service. I understand that these are unusual times but they should at least make an effort to provide accurate and honest answers to customer inquiries. My experience is similar to what others are recounting so I'll keep it short... When I placed my order on the Logitech website the item (webcam) showed in stock. They took my money and after a week I requested an update and I was told that it was pending but there was no ETA I then pointed out that according to their website I should not have been charged until my item shipped and said they could not refund my money because I used PayPal. I my experience that is not true. I asked them to cancel my order because my order has clearly not shipped and as you might guess they said that since the order was sent to the warehouse it could not be cancelled. Needles to say that when I eventually get my product I am going to return it unopened and I will never buy another Logitech product again.

  Would give zero stars if I could.  Ordered a Brio Ultra HD Pro Webcam on 28th March that said it was in stock and paid extra for 2 day delivery as I desperately needed it for work (I cancelled an order elsewhere that had one on backorder). Contacted Logitech a few days later as I had no despatch note, and was then informed by the team they had a 7-10 day backlog in picking (thanks for not telling me earlier), but not to worry because the product was definitely in stock. Oh by the way, the extra payment for delivery was apparently only the delivery timescale once it was picked, not from order to delivery! Waited patiently for 8 days for my despatch note email and then received an email from Logitech (great!) saying that I would NOT get the item until June as there was a backlog (WTH?!) - what happened to my product that was definitely in stock and just being picked!  Checked my bank statement and they had taken payment when ordered so I contacted their team to cancel the order and they said it would take 7 - 10 days to process a refund and there is nothing they could do, no discussion, that was their process (well my process is that if you take my money immediately you return it immediately, funnily enough they work to whatever they want to). So there you go, appalling £215 out of pocket until they refund, 20 days after taking my money (still waiting). Avoid ordering direct at all cost, I hope this review helps at least one other person avoid this situation. I wish I had done a search on reviews first, but you expect a company like Logitech with decent products to offer an equally decent buying service - this is sadly not the case.

So there you go, appalling Â£215 out of pocket until they refund, 20 days after taking my money (still waiting). Avoid ordering direct at all cost, I hope this review helps at least one other person avoid this situation. I wish I had done a search on reviews first, but you expect a company like Logitech with decent products to offer an equally decent buying service - this is sadly not the case.

  Very dishonest company. They take you money and then shut down their phone support. They they lle and suggest you can fix what ever your problem is via E-Mail. They they offer chat and give you a tiocketr number. What the hell is that good for? Avoid this company.

  I've never seen a company so difficult to contact. It's easier contacting a major airline's customer service than Logitech. If I have a question for Delta airlines, for example, I just send them a DM via Twitter and I get a near-instant response. Logitech @Logitech doesn't even accept DMs. It is SO FRUSTRATING!!!! Pretty solid products but HORRIFIC customer service.

  I ordered on 1st of April one Brio Stream web camera and one MX Master 3 mice. When I ordered both, they were available according to the online store. The update from Logitech was that both shipped and they would be delivered. When I checked with UPS, I worried as the package seamed too small. Finally, on the 6th of April, the package arrived, but it contained only the mice.  The call centre is not available, and I managed to open a ticket where I had not received any update from them. Luckily enough, I purchased the items using PayPal, so I filled a claim through PayPal for a refund.  If you check in their forums, there are more than 2.000 complaints with shipment issues.  Verdict: Logitech owns me 220 GBP not calculating my time that I need to spend for making a claim back, any interest that I am loosing and that I am not able to do my work.  Although they have friendly products avoid at any cost ordering from their online shop and good luck if you find anything available in the online retailers. Update on 14.04.2020 I filled a claim with PayPal as Logitech is unable to provide any kind of support. What they are proposing is for me to wait for them to ship the product (they don't know when), deny the package and when the package reaches back their warehouse they can issue a refund.  Update on 21.04.2020 They didn't manage to cancel the shipping on time, and they stick to their process, which means that I need to wait for an extra two to three weeks for the camera to be returned to their central hub in Holland from the UK and then proceed with the refund. In the meantime, they are not responding to PayPal on my dispute claim.  Update 26.04.2020 PayPal closed the dispute on my favour. Logitech didn't bother to reply to PayPal at all.  Conclusion As Logitech has friendly products and at the same time retailers don't have availability, as Logitech has better margins to sell direct, buy from Logitech but only if you are using PayPal and you are ready to get delayed. Another advice from my side, buy one product per order if it is possible.

  Would give zero stars if I could.  Ordered a Brio Ultra HD Pro Webcam on 28th March that said it was in stock and paid extra for 2 day delivery as I desperately needed it for work (I cancelled an order elsewhere that had one on backorder). Contacted Logitech a few days later as I had no despatch note, and was then informed by the team they had a 7-10 day backlog in picking (thanks for not telling me earlier), but not to worry because the product was definitely in stock. Oh by the way, the extra payment for delivery was apparently only the delivery timescale once it was picked, not from order to delivery!

  Bought the Slim Folio Pro keyboard for my 12 inch iPad Pro (3rd Gen) last summer and have found it to be outstanding. I use the iPad and Logitech keyboard every day for work and it is faultless. It is light, yet tough. The back light helps enormously. When I was buying my iPad in the apple store I found the Apple equivalent to feel more flimsy and was recommended to try this Logitech. It’s brilliant. Well done, well worth it!

  A horrible seller. Place order for something that shows in stock. Get charged immediately. 2 weeks later no status change , no communications. In the mean time, the web site shows out of stock. No way to contact - took chat down, no phones, no email address. Finally get form letter saying the order is delayed, can't provide any info, NO CANCELLATIONS, when I receive I can send back for return (no doubt at my cost) - and get a refund in about 3 weeks after they get it returned. They already charged me for this item - NEVER again will I buy anything with a Logitech name.

  I had though that i had a good headset (logitech G933). Until i realized that i wasn't using the Logitech software that is recommended along with it. FOR TWO YEARS, without this software, i had the perfect headset. Until i got Logitech G hub. Immediately after getting the software my headset started bugging out and muting my Mic. Furthermore, now as of the newest update my ability to regulate volume has started to bug out as well! I would attempt to turn down my volume, but whats this? I moved it a milometer down but it has decided to ________ BLAST MY VOLUME TO MAX? thank G HUB! You may think, hey... it worked fine before right? why not get rig of G hub! GREAT IDEA! So i DID!~ Guess what, NO CHANGES WHAT SO EVER. I have even reinstalled my computer... ALL OF THESE BUGS STILL PERSIST and i haven't even installed G HUB ON MY NEW FRESH BLANK WINDOWS... ____ YOU, THANKS FOR RUINING MY HEADSET! (oh did i also mention that G HUB cant see my LOGITECH GAMING KEYBOARD [G105]?) I am so infuriated, i enjoy when the product i purchase last their intended lifetimes. I guess Logitech's intended product lifetime is until they deem that you need to make a purchase once again. ____ YOU, im never buying a Logitech product as long as i live! NOTHING.

  Zero transparency about back-orders or shipping times. Specifically selected logitech due it's prior reputation, but this is probably the end of my using any of their products.

  I own the following hardwear. G915 keyboard,powerplay mat,the g903 and 502 mice,G560 speakers and G933 headpjones. They are great bits of kit. Good quality reliable and i would recommened themto anyone.But........Ghub!!! What an absolute piece of crap. Whoever, designed this softwear needs firing and never work on softwear again. It is litterally the worst piece of softwear ive ever used. All the peripherals show up with no problem.I can sync the lighting so they all match, which is fine. But the point of having all these light effects is so you can sync games profiles, so eveything works together and without pulling your hair out trying to get it to do basic tasks, like find the games running on the computer. I thought i was possibly doing something worng or missing something. However, a quick search on the web just confirms i'm not alone. It seems everyone is having similar issues and the complaints are the same. The previous softwear worked well, not perfect, but at least it found my games and automatically set up the lighting profiles. It wasn't a nice looking as Ghub but, honestly, whos cares what it looks like as long as it works!! The quick solution would be to bring back the older softwear, which no longer works and if you try and download it directs you to Ghub. Logitech have been around for years, but this softwear makes them looks like a newbie, with little understanding of what the user wants. Something that just works!

  Create an online order where it says 2 days delivery and it just sits there for a week with a status of 'In Process'. Go to online chat to find out what's going on and they just say they don't know when it will go and they hang up the chat. No way to cancel other than a support email and have heard nothing back. Won't use again.

  I wanted to order a webcam so I can hold video conferences from home - understandably many companies are out of stock. So I ordered one directly from Logitech and paid extra (£15) for 2-3 day delivery. Needless to say after 3 days: no webcam, no tracking number, no information on website and no way of contacting customer services. If they're out of stock or experiencing delays because of Covid-19 they should say this upfront (like other companies) when you're placing the order. So I've sent an email cancelling my order - if no refund in a week's time I'll be contacting my credit card company. Update: after one week received a reply from the email address given in their T&amp;Cs (in the cancellation section) to say they don't deal with cancellations - so apparently no way of cancelling the order.

  Honestly, I like their products, however they just suck at providing customer service. There is almost no way to contact them about a specific thing you need answers for. Looked all over their website and there is a few ways to contact them. However, the contact info provide is only for certain products. Their website has no way to contact them about general issues (orders,products,etc). I ordered a headset with the ""fast"" shipping option and its not even on its way. I just want to know what is going with my order.

  Bought a 100€ mouse that promised Logitech Flow and configurable buttons. I work both on Windows and macOS so it was a no-brainer. I got two Macs, the mouse works with Flow on the older one (Mojave) and my Windows computer but not on the one with macOS Catalina 10.15.3. I contacted the support, reiterated 10 times that there is a software issue with Logitech Options, what I got back were the permission articles which I've seen a hundred times and set everything up correctly and then they were like: replace your mouse on warranty. There is no hardware problem the mouse works fine with the older Mac but I didn't splash 2400 on a new computer just to keep on using the old one. With how Logitech Options behaves on macOS Catalina 10.15.3, I cannot use Logitech Flow, cannot even map my buttons the way I want them because they get reset each time. As long as your product works, all is good. When it only stops working they way it should the support guys are unbelievably clueless. Is it really that hard to let the dev team ""we got a bug""? I am a dev myself, indicated that I'll be happy to provide them with logs, plists and whatever they need to fix it. Nah, just replace your mouse, for sure it'll work. -_-

Please, I repeat, never buy a mouse from this awful company, my previous Logitech mouse which was a g502 hero (which is like their best mouse) lasted nearly 2 weeks before it started double clicking and about a month after that it just died, Please Logitech just stop scamming people to buy your fake wannabe computer mice

But no... it's worst. On the old mouse, this problem started to happen in a few months while on MX Master 3 the problem showed up in 1 week, there's a big shiny spot on the left button. The device is clean, I clean my peripherals almost daily. I would be ok to pay a bit more just to get better materials.

  Logitech MX Master 3 starts making weird doubling clicking sounds on left click and the mouse wheel seems to be loose. All of that happened within a month with minimal use. The customer support offered my first some tips on how to check my bluetooth connection and if everything is plugged in (wow!). After that, someone replied again asking me to make a video of the problem, like what the hell? Why can't I just send it back for investigation/RMA? Seems to be to hard for this company. Will not buy from Logitech again, on many ends the MX Master 3 is cheap as hell. Low polling rate and breaking, crackling components after a month, WOW.

Mouse was purchased on amazon europe site and send to my country of residence, i ve contacted amazon and they can refund me if i send it back but this was bought in a promotion and therefore price now is significant more , i contacted logitech support requesting rma , after providing proof of purchase etc they send me this stupid msg Thank you for the response, I would like to inform you we do not support International warranties. In order to get warranty coverage, your product must be exchanged from the country of purchase. We suggest that you contact the place of purchase to see if they have an International warranty option. If we can help in any other way, please let us know. You can find our warranty terms and conditions here Thank you for choosing Logitech G. For sure i wont do the same mistake again to choose logitech ,under european legislation they are forced to provide warranty in european union , i asked to escalate this to a supervisor but i dont see that they will oblige .

  Product has broken 14 months into its life. Logitech don’t want to know and can’t even advise anything as product discontinued. It is an Apple Ipad Pro II Create Backlit Cover. Clearly had I known it was going to be discontinued then I wouldn’t have spent over £130 on it a little over a year ago. Problem is the cheap plastic around the side of the cover breaks off (a common problem according to other reviewers) and therefore it doesn’t hold the Ipad in place. I wouldn’t buy any Logitech products again after this experience and would advise others against doing so.

Problem is the cheap plastic around the side of the cover breaks off (a common problem according to other reviewers) and therefore it doesnâ€™t hold the Ipad in place. I wouldnâ€™t buy any Logitech products again after this experience and would advise others against doing so.

  What Customer Service. I ordered an item last week, received an order confirmation but then the charge was removed from my credit card.......they had apparently cancelled my order without telling me. When I tried to order again, the item was listed as out of stock. I submitted an inquiry to customer service but no response except they sent my inquiry back to me and nothing else. What the?????

  Just opened a G600 purchased last year, left-click stuck, slow bounce back, which make double clicking sometimes not perform. Contact the support with the issue. Keep asking me to provide a photo to reproduce the issue. A photo? How? That's a waste of my time, so I tossed the mouse away, not happy with their service provided.

  Ordered on the 2/15. Site said arrival 4-7 business days. In touch with customer support they said "" it should be in stock on the 20th"". When I placed the order there was no notification of "" out of stock"". Website has shown in stock ( except for one day i checked that said out of stock) and no emails or notification from them. They took my money out of my account fast, but still no shipping as of 2/25 ( 10 days later).  I had to laugh when they sent me a email advertising Free expedited shipping on items. I tested and it ""could"" be applied to the same item I bought and am still waiting for. Who are they kidding? I would be weary of ordering and go retail if you HAVE to have a Logitech item. But I would be concerned if they will actually fulfill any warranty requests. I wonder if they have new management, because in the past I never had such issues with them.

  Very poor Customer Service - Emails were back and forth with no real resolution. Their representative is not sure of they're refund requirements and so he asked me to destroy the product and give them the photos - which I did. The next email said that, the refund can't be processed because they needed a ""VAT invoice"". Given the circumstances, I may not be able to provide it as I purchased it in a third party company. Point is, they asked me to destroy it first before confirming with me the requirements for the refund. Now I don't have the refund - and my faulty C920 Camera is now fully destroyed by me. Funny. Also, their email representatives' emails are redundant and they seem to not read through the emails carefully and just responds meaninglessly. The email thread went for 1 month and about 43 emails sent and received. I'll never purchase again from Logitech as the customer service and possibly the products are very unsatisfactory.

  Hey everyone...well, I’m not big in writing positive reviews but I’m a plumber so customer reviews are always a huge plus...when people actually write a review when they’re satisfied. So I will get to the point, I bought this Universal Folio a couple weeks ago and could not activate it to my iPad 6 and went first with Apple, but Apple will not help since, “its not an apple product”, and so I dreaded the moment of having to call this manufacturer since 1) I had never heard of them and 2) it was cheap. Red flag: possibly people with sucky customer support. I was proven wrong. Called and did not stay on hold for long. And on top of that, once the rep and I spoke, he was right to the point and got my Folio activated without any hassles. AND he emailed me a bigger troubleshooting manual for future issues. (But this was my only issue so I’m not worried about others). So idk if it was beginners luck or if others are too picky but I’m a happy customer. Great product and cool rep I spoke with. I will recommend this product to others and I’ll sure be looking further deep into other products to purchase!

  TL;DR Customer support fails, does not give you your money back even if it's your right. Do not purchase a product from Logitech if you want this mess to happen to you too. Every other review here says it: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!  I used to own a G933 (headset). Due to a faulty design choice the switch comes loose after a few months and each time I contacted the support and received a replacement device. I did this twice, (3 headsets in total) but after the fourth time in almost 2 years I've had enough and asked for a refund (As a European citizen I have this right).... Boy oh boy I've been waiting for 4 months now.. - 31st of October 2019, I sent a message with all the details and the fact it's the fourth time now. They promised me in November 2019 that I'd get my money back within a short period of time, asking me for some contact information. I gave them all the info, but then politely asked me to let my legal guardian to create a new ticket (mentioning the old ticket) for the refund to progress as I'm only 17 and thus not of legal age. They immediately updated the status to ""solved"" without any message, and this is where everything went south. I then decided to contact the customer service through phone, after giving them my information once again they said they'd pass it through the refund process and that I'd receive a mail in 3-5 business days. This was on the 19th of December. On the 8th of January I then once again asked them about the status, and they told me ""we have sent another follow up to check the status for the refund."" Today, the 14th of January, I have sent yet another mail to ask for the status, stating that I've been waiting for 4 months now and that it would've taken ""up to 3-5 business days"" according to them. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get my money back?

Chat option provides NO ANSWERS. They sent an order confirmation email (for an ipad keyboard) with a link to check order status. Click on the link and it requires you to sign up/in to get to your order info. Which although correct on the email was INCORRECT on their web site.

  Over the years I've bought around 20 Logitech mice. I stick with Logitech because they have proper customisation software for all the mouse buttons, and I use all the buttons for my specific task-oriented purposes. However recently, all the customisations become inactive, after a PC running Windows 10 wakes from a 'sleep'. Thus all my investment in Logitech mice is now trashed, and I have to work around this limitation by using gesture control (which is performed by PC software and operates independently of the Logitech software and hardware). I have been communicating with Logitech over the past 3 months, and given them every single dump and bit of date they've asked for, and now they are basically ignoring me.  How hard can it be to fix a reproducible problem like this? How hard up can Logitech be that they can't buy or borrow a Microsoft Surface Pro to test out their devices? This is a disgrace.

  I had a g510 back in 2014-15, sold for a g910, few weeks later the buyer contacted me he wanted his money back cause g keys stopped working all at a sudden; fun fact I never used these keys, I just bought that keyboard for stilish metallic blue-grey paint .-.. Another fun fact is that after a year the spacebar switch on 910 broke. I bought 2, not 1, 2!! g35 and both broke in the same spot: a pivot near earcup, same for a friend of mine who also had one of the worst experiences with customer service cause of this; same story for the first release of g502,I had to ask for replace first moths cause left click used to register more clicks, and again g903 sensor went burnt, now I have a cool piece of rgb furniture on my desk that reminds me everytime: ""don't buy this waay overpriced piece of bat guano with a big g on it"". -Proud owner of a ducky one keyboard that still doesn't show a problem after 2 years of use.

  i used to own a bundle of of logitech keyboard k360 and m185 mouse which they came together, after a year the mouse stopped working and after research i bought the same type of mouse to pair with my keyboard in one dongle. its seems the mouse i bought (m185) communicates with different protocol and how much i searched it cannon communicate together with the previous dongle. nor the new dongle works with the keyboard. it seems the latter is nano receiver and the new is unyfying or vice versa. Now after six months the new dongle usb contacts had delaminated from the board and i have a broken mouse dongle and an orphan keyboard. What a poor product quality and support. Well i stopped and i will spread to people to stop buying from this company as it doesnt honor their products and frustrate the customers as i can read from reviews. Enjoy the fall ""poortech""

  Really poor experience of Logitech customer service. I foolishly thought that being such a big company I would not need to check site reviews on trustpilot.... How wrong was I. It took them.one month to provide me with return authorisation details. This was only after they had closed no less than 3 support tickets without my consent. When I finally did get the return authorisation the item needed to be returned to California depsite being purchased in the UK Logitech store. Customer service were unsure of how to best complete the customs paperwork. Fortunately I managed to sell the item rather than return it as I had very little faith my refund would be handled well once they received the item.  A total shambles. Avoid at all costs, I dread to think what their warranty support is like.

  The woman ended up transferring me 2 times. Once I got there, she was telling me what to do but wasn't making sure I was following along. I got lost multiple times and she didn't bother to help with such. I then got called ""sir"" 5 times when I clearly sound female and told them my female name. The call lasted 46 minutes and I asked to be passed to someone else maybe and she refused that idea multiple times. At the 40 minute mark she said the call has lasted too long for her to handle and that I would have to call back another day to someone else because we were taking too long. I feel as you shouldn't tell customers to call a different day because you dont want to deal with their long issue tech problems. Anyways, at the end of this 46 minute call, we resolved nothing and my problem still remains. I ended up just calling a friend after this happened and we solved my issue in less than 20 minutes. Their customer service sucks.

  Worse customer service experience I have ever had. I bought a Logitech G Pro Keyboard. Withing a few months they the Ctrl keycap came off. The pegs that latch into sockets on the actual board broke off inside the sockets. There was really no way for me to fix it. Because the Roamer G switches are proprietary, I can’t just buy a new keycap and replace it and because the pegs broke inside the socket I couldn’t replace the keycap even if I had that option. I contacted Logitech support to request that they fix the keyboard because it was under warranty.  This is where things started to go downhill. At first they requested that I send them a proof of purchase and pictures of the damage. After I did this they alleged that they were unable to view the pictures I sent them. They then requested that I make a video of the damage. I also did this and they also said they were unable to view the video that I sent to them.  At this point I was very frustrated. Later on the Logitech representative admits that they had actually in fact seen the photos but that they needed a video in order to process the warranty. I told them I had sent the video multiple times over email. They then requested me to provide them with a Google Drive link for them to download it or to upload them to youtube. I told them that I would do no such thing. That I have a right to keep my accounts with other companies private and that they should provide their customers with a way for us to send them the videos directly if that is part of their warranty process.  They refused to process the warranty. At this point I questioned them as to why I couldn’t just ship the keyboard directly to them to inspect and repair the damage. They refused and then asked me to actually send them a video of me destroying the keyboard so they can send me a new one. Of course I completely refused. The request is just outrageous. Especially given the fact that I had already sent them video over email and claimed they didn’t get it and now they are asking me to make a video of me destroying the keyboard? Finally they “closed” they ticket and refused to honor the warranty!

  What a dysfunctional, useless support service. Had a warranty claim for a £47 headset (nine months in), so tried registering on their website - and got 'page not found' errors. (One of the two main support links on their website goes to 'page not found', which tells you how much they care about follow-up support!) Rang their call centre (which required me to call an overseas number from the UK!), and after spending 15mins taking my details over a very poor-quality line, the agent told me she couldn't help me - each product has a different team, and I'd have to wait up to 2 days for that specific team to call me back! Fortunately, I'd actually bought the product through Amazon, so I contacted them, and they were brilliant - they've already despatched a replacement headset, and given me a pre-paid label to send back the old one. Lesson: don't ever buy anything directly off Logitech, their follow-up support is terrible - buy it off Amazon or a retail store instead, and use them for follow-up support.

So I will get to the point, I bought this Universal Folio a couple weeks ago and could not activate it to my iPad 6 and went first with Apple, but Apple will not help since, â€œits not an apple productâ€, and so I dreaded the moment of having to call this manufacturer since 1) I had never heard of them and 2) it was cheap. Red flag: possibly people with sucky customer support. I was proven wrong. Called and did not stay on hold for long. And on top of that, once the rep and I spoke, he was right to the point and got my Folio activated without any hassles. AND he emailed me a bigger troubleshooting manual for future issues. (But this was my only issue so Iâ€™m not worried about others). So idk if it was beginners luck or if others are too picky but Iâ€™m a happy customer. Great product and cool rep I spoke with. I will recommend this product to others and Iâ€™ll sure be looking further deep into other products to purchase!

  TL;DR Customer support fails, does not give you your money back even if it's your right. Do not purchase a product from Logitech if you want this mess to happen to you too. Every other review here says it: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!  I used to own a G933 (headset). Due to a faulty design choice the switch comes loose after a few months and each time I contacted the support and received a replacement device. I did this twice, (3 headsets in total) but after the fourth time in almost 2 years I've had enough and asked for a refund (As a European citizen I have this right).... Boy oh boy I've been waiting for 4 months now.. - 31st of October 2019, I sent a message with all the details and the fact it's the fourth time now. They promised me in November 2019 that I'd get my money back within a short period of time, asking me for some contact information. I gave them all the info, but then politely asked me to let my legal guardian to create a new ticket (mentioning the old ticket) for the refund to progress as I'm only 17 and thus not of legal age. They immediately updated the status to ""solved"" without any message, and this is where everything went south. I then decided to contact the customer service through phone, after giving them my information once again they said they'd pass it through the refund process and that I'd receive a mail in 3-5 business days. This was on the 19th of December. On the 8th of January I then once again asked them about the status, and they told me ""we have sent another follow up to check the status for the refund."" Today, the 14th of January, I have sent yet another mail to ask for the status, stating that I've been waiting for 4 months now and that it would've taken ""up to 3-5 business days"" according to them. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get my money back?

  What has happened to this company? It used to have great customer service. Now —  No customer service phone number or email. No shipping information available. No easy way to cancel your order. Chat option provides NO ANSWERS. They sent an order confirmation email (for an ipad keyboard) with a link to check order status. Click on the link and it requires you to sign up/in to get to your order info. Which although correct on the email was INCORRECT on their web site.  Really sad to see a good company go down like this.

It's now January 2020 and they've done nothing but stall and get me to unnecessarily jump through hoops. There's no mechanism to speak to anyone beyond the standard off-shore call centre operators.

  Over the years I've bought around 20 Logitech mice. I stick with Logitech because they have proper customisation software for all the mouse buttons, and I use all the buttons for my specific task-oriented purposes. However recently, all the customisations become inactive, after a PC running Windows 10 wakes from a 'sleep'. Thus all my investment in Logitech mice is now trashed, and I have to work around this limitation by using gesture control (which is performed by PC software and operates independently of the Logitech software and hardware). I have been communicating with Logitech over the past 3 months, and given them every single dump and bit of date they've asked for, and now they are basically ignoring me.  How hard can it be to fix a reproducible problem like this? How hard up can Logitech be that they can't buy or borrow a Microsoft Surface Pro to test out their devices? This is a disgrace.

  I had a g510 back in 2014-15, sold for a g910, few weeks later the buyer contacted me he wanted his money back cause g keys stopped working all at a sudden; fun fact I never used these keys, I just bought that keyboard for stilish metallic blue-grey paint .-.. Another fun fact is that after a year the spacebar switch on 910 broke. I bought 2, not 1, 2!! g35 and both broke in the same spot: a pivot near earcup, same for a friend of mine who also had one of the worst experiences with customer service cause of this; same story for the first release of g502,I had to ask for replace first moths cause left click used to register more clicks, and again g903 sensor went burnt, now I have a cool piece of rgb furniture on my desk that reminds me everytime: ""don't buy this waay overpriced piece of bat guano with a big g on it"". -Proud owner of a ducky one keyboard that still doesn't show a problem after 2 years of use.

  i used to own a bundle of of logitech keyboard k360 and m185 mouse which they came together, after a year the mouse stopped working and after research i bought the same type of mouse to pair with my keyboard in one dongle. its seems the mouse i bought (m185) communicates with different protocol and how much i searched it cannon communicate together with the previous dongle. nor the new dongle works with the keyboard. it seems the latter is nano receiver and the new is unyfying or vice versa. Now after six months the new dongle usb contacts had delaminated from the board and i have a broken mouse dongle and an orphan keyboard. What a poor product quality and support. Well i stopped and i will spread to people to stop buying from this company as it doesnt honor their products and frustrate the customers as i can read from reviews. Enjoy the fall ""poortech""

  Really poor experience of Logitech customer service. I foolishly thought that being such a big company I would not need to check site reviews on trustpilot.... How wrong was I. It took them.one month to provide me with return authorisation details. This was only after they had closed no less than 3 support tickets without my consent. When I finally did get the return authorisation the item needed to be returned to California depsite being purchased in the UK Logitech store. Customer service were unsure of how to best complete the customs paperwork. Fortunately I managed to sell the item rather than return it as I had very little faith my refund would be handled well once they received the item.  A total shambles. Avoid at all costs, I dread to think what their warranty support is like.

  The woman ended up transferring me 2 times. Once I got there, she was telling me what to do but wasn't making sure I was following along. I got lost multiple times and she didn't bother to help with such. I then got called ""sir"" 5 times when I clearly sound female and told them my female name. The call lasted 46 minutes and I asked to be passed to someone else maybe and she refused that idea multiple times. At the 40 minute mark she said the call has lasted too long for her to handle and that I would have to call back another day to someone else because we were taking too long. I feel as you shouldn't tell customers to call a different day because you dont want to deal with their long issue tech problems. Anyways, at the end of this 46 minute call, we resolved nothing and my problem still remains. I ended up just calling a friend after this happened and we solved my issue in less than 20 minutes. Their customer service sucks.

  I have a K750 keyboard and a Logitech wireless mouse. I have a receiver, I followed the instructions on unifying the devices onto one computer; downloaded the unifying software and only one of these devices will pair with the computer. The phone number on the Logitech website is missing a digit and I need to get this resolved soon. Frustrating!

  Worse customer service experience I have ever had. I bought a Logitech G Pro Keyboard. Withing a few months they the Ctrl keycap came off. The pegs that latch into sockets on the actual board broke off inside the sockets. There was really no way for me to fix it. Because the Roamer G switches are proprietary, I can’t just buy a new keycap and replace it and because the pegs broke inside the socket I couldn’t replace the keycap even if I had that option. I contacted Logitech support to request that they fix the keyboard because it was under warranty.  This is where things started to go downhill. At first they requested that I send them a proof of purchase and pictures of the damage. After I did this they alleged that they were unable to view the pictures I sent them. They then requested that I make a video of the damage. I also did this and they also said they were unable to view the video that I sent to them.  At this point I was very frustrated. Later on the Logitech representative admits that they had actually in fact seen the photos but that they needed a video in order to process the warranty. I told them I had sent the video multiple times over email. They then requested me to provide them with a Google Drive link for them to download it or to upload them to youtube. I told them that I would do no such thing. That I have a right to keep my accounts with other companies private and that they should provide their customers with a way for us to send them the videos directly if that is part of their warranty process.  They refused to process the warranty. At this point I questioned them as to why I couldn’t just ship the keyboard directly to them to inspect and repair the damage. They refused and then asked me to actually send them a video of me destroying the keyboard so they can send me a new one. Of course I completely refused. The request is just outrageous. Especially given the fact that I had already sent them video over email and claimed they didn’t get it and now they are asking me to make a video of me destroying the keyboard? Finally they “closed” they ticket and refused to honor the warranty!

  What a dysfunctional, useless support service. Had a warranty claim for a £47 headset (nine months in), so tried registering on their website - and got 'page not found' errors. (One of the two main support links on their website goes to 'page not found', which tells you how much they care about follow-up support!) Rang their call centre (which required me to call an overseas number from the UK!), and after spending 15mins taking my details over a very poor-quality line, the agent told me she couldn't help me - each product has a different team, and I'd have to wait up to 2 days for that specific team to call me back! Fortunately, I'd actually bought the product through Amazon, so I contacted them, and they were brilliant - they've already despatched a replacement headset, and given me a pre-paid label to send back the old one. Lesson: don't ever buy anything directly off Logitech, their follow-up support is terrible - buy it off Amazon or a retail store instead, and use them for follow-up support.

  I purchased a keyboard as pre-order. The website stated delivery in November, but did not specify a date. After 2 weeks of silence (but having paid for the product) I chased it online and a week later got a response (25th November: ""Upon checking on our system that your order is on process but we are waiting for the product will be available because as of the moment the product is not yet available, don't worry because once the product will be available we are going to prioritize your order""). Unhappy with the response, I phoned support (as 'customer service' is not available from this company). The support team placed a ticket to cancel my purchase (27th of November). I also requested her to send me an email confirming my cancellation. By the 6th of December I had not received any confirmation of cancellation of the order, no product and they still had my money. After a very long conversation on the phone, they sent me an email letting me know the manager would call back that same day. When he called back, I had already received an email cancelling my order, but the manager seemed to know little about this. None of their communications came with any apologies or estimated dates of delivery. The phone conversations lacked in useful information or professionalism.

  i bought a Logitech k750 last year. the keys fell out of keyboard. I know these things happen, so did not worry as I should be covered by a warranty. Well I thought I would be covered by a warranty , but Logitech refused to honor my warranty.  Logitech customer service sent me on a wild goose chase, which ended up in them asking me for my original receipt after two months. Really appalled by the refusal of Logitech to process a warranty for me because I did not have original receipt. Who nowadays keep their original receipts ( which Logitech know). I requested to best buy to give me receipt, but best buy only keep receipts on their system for 3 months ( which LOGITECH know) I did provide a bank statement that proves I made purchase but Logitech refuse to asknowledge this. . ill never buy from Logitech again, yes they have good products, but they are a cunning company. there have been plenty of occasions when I did not have original receipt, but manufacter still honoured the warrantly. My advise do not buy from Logitech if you think they will honor your warranty, they wont. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, NO DOUBT THEY WILL DELETE THIS POST, BUT THEY WONT DELETE MY POST ON OTHER REVIEW SITES IM GOING TO POST THIS ON.

  Logitech are CLUELESS. Loved the Harmony 700. Needed an update on ONE remote. They changed their software so ALL your devices and activities MUST go on one remote. I had two remotes: one for one room and another for another room with different set of devices and activities. Now it DROPPED devices and activities and won't let me sync one set of Harmony devices. AND I just bought two new ones on the internet that are NOW GARBAGE! I can only hope my older harmony software will still separate the two devices or I now own 5 useless devices!

  Ihnfc what everyone here is talking about. Everytime I have a problem with a mouse, keyboard or headset or anything else from them, they are so eager to send a replacement free of charge. I have a G710+ (which they don't make anymore since it's really old) and I had a problem with it and they told me that they couldn't send out a new one(because they don't make them anymore) BUT that I could get $150 towards one of their newer gaming keyboards which btw is enough to get any gaming kb on their website except for the G910 and it was all completely free of charge. I ended up getting the G613 and just ended up selling it to buy a refurbished G710+ from Newegg. I ended up making $75 in the process. I even had a $40 mouse (G403) and a $70 keyboard(G410) break because my monitor fell on them. I told Logitech and again they sent me a replacement for both free of charge.  I had a Logitech G430(Gaming headset) that I lost the dongle for which btw I bought refurbished for way lower than retail price and again, they sent me a replacement for the entire headset(not just the dongle) and once again free of charge. I don't even know how they afford to do this but they do and it is why I try to buy all my peripherals from Logitech. I have a Blue mic(which is owned by Logitech), a Saitek flight stick and throttle(also owned by Logitech) and a G502 and G710+ right now. The only thing I don't have that is Logitech is a headset but that is purely because they don't make high end headsets like Sennheiser does. I made multiple accounts with Logitech just to make sure they don't pick customers at random to give the special treatment to and that isn't the case. Time and time again they just replace the product no matter what.

  Tried to order, impossible to pay. Cancelled order, got lost in an online circle of misery, No contact information, no e-mail, no telephone and once again simply could not work the dreadful website. Made a complaint on social media. Sometime later...I'm contacted by Logitech and asked to describe my issues, why would I spend my valuable time helping them work to repair their own web site? surely they check the efficiency of their own site? 3 weeks later and I'm now receiving e-mails asking me to complete my order. In summary: dreadful web site, torturous experience. No help or support to make the order but too much contact after the order is cancelled. Get it together Logitech.

Logitech customer services followed the case closely and I was receiving a daily call with progress update.

  We put a TV in the living room and components in a closet. This remote was supposed to facilitate that. We have had problems with the remote EVERYTIME we come to stay.

  If I could give zero stars, I would. I bought a Logitech crayon for my IPAD. It worked great when it arrived. After attempting to recharge, the pen would not hold the charge. We tried different chargers to no avail. The green light refused to stay on. I spent 2 hours working with Logitech, jumping through hoops with regard to my IOS version, when all that was wrong was that the pen wouldn't charge. After 2 hours, she took all of the info to replace the pen and said I'd receive an email about the replacement within 72 hours. 2 days later, I received an email, asking me to do all of the same, idiotic stuff I had already done with the representative 2 days before. Don't buy anything from these morons unless you buy through Amazon. Good grief.

  I placed an order for an MX Master 3 mouse and heard nothing for five days. They have no customer service line so you have to ask their community board or call technical support for answers. Technical support found that the product was not in stock and would take a couple days. Their website continued listing the item as ""in stock"" potentially defrauding more customers. After not hearing back again, I asked for a refund, which was had to be forwarded to review, again they are not reachable by phone. Two weeks after placing my order and a week after cancelling it, I received shipping notification for the now cancelled order. I had to again call the technical support line, was promised an answer within the day, and then found out that they would have to recall the shipment, and would only issue a refund once they received the item they mistakenly shipped because they could not process a cancellation in time. I'm not sure who handles their customer service and ordering system but it's an absolute crime how poorly they handled this.

  This company is 100% ridiculous. I have a slim Logi folio that I purchased less than a year ago during Black Friday for an iPad. It was NOT cheap - I believe it cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 on sale. The regular price was more than that. Well, less than a year later, so still under warranty, a piece is coming off of it. The problem is that I don’t actually know what function the piece serves. It’s a little strip across the top part of the iPad section of the case when it’s in portrait mode. It could be purely cosmetic or it could be an essential part of the case. I searched and couldn’t figure it out though so I contacted Logitech to ask before taking all the steps to file a claim. Instead of answering my one sentence simple question, they sent me a two page form email with very involved instructions on filing a claim against the warranty. Of course this irritated me. I just want my question answered first. If this is a cosmetic issue with the case then I’m not going to claim on the warranty. As long as it doesn’t affect the function I’m fine with this piece doing whatever. But they didn’t simply answer my question. I don’t think they even really read my question or looked at the support ticket at all, because part of what the form email they sent requested was a dated picture depicting the damage, WHICH I SENT IN WITH THE SUPPORT TICKET!!! The photo attached to my question on that ticket clearly shows the date and the damage to the item. All in all, the customer service is terrible. I ended up responding to their response asking that they answer my question first. NO RESPONSE BACK. I don’t think this company is interested in providing actual customer service. They don’t seem to care about their customers at all. I won’t be buying any Logitech item in the future ever again. EVER. AGAIN. I sincerely mean that. I’ll go out of my way to avoid them after how ridiculous they’re being with this. A company that can’t perform basic customer service tasks isn’t going to have me as a customer.

I also supplied multiple other details they requested. I call them around 15 times and they kept saying they are working on my claim only to receive an e-mail today stating ""your warranty claim has been rejected because the device has already been registered"" I couldn't believe it I registered the device when I purchased it directly from Logitech!!!!! grrrrr so frustrating they want me to send a video of me holding the device with a note on it and the ticket number written on the note! I feel like a criminal in a line up! absolutely awful experience and customer service I really cannot believe the lack of consideration and lack of professionalism they have shown, avoid Logitech at all costs!

  Frustrating is an understatement trying to get support. I'm ask a simple question about a function of a product yet instead of trying to help it's like talking to a robot parrot. How many times do I have to provide a model and serial number before I actually get a human response instead of what seems to be an automated email template. I'm running out of patience. They keep closing the case. How much time am I supposed to waste trying to find out a simple answer on how to switch from Bluetooth to a dongle for a cheap media keyboard and track pad. Tempted to send it back to them in small pieces. It's 4am and this is almost harassment now. The product isn't even listed on their menus for support. This is ridiculous

  I have a harmony one hub remote. Great product and reliable for over 5 years. However when some issues arose the CS response was I should buy a new one for 400 plus and here is a coupon for 10 percent off. The reality is that the battery went. For 25 bucks and two Diya to deliver...new battery open up the remote with ease. Unplug the old battery, plug in the new one and back in business.

  The least durable mice on the planet. You are lucky if you can use one straight for 6 months. Seriously I havent been able to. Either a mouse button will give out or the mouse sensitivlity would be all over the place. And thats with regular use, but if you drop the mouse with two feet that mouse if done for. And I am speaking from experience of owning more than 10 Logitech mice over the past 5 years.Dont get me wrong the mouse has nice features, that Logitech probably have patented, because otherwise nobody would buy their stuff. My recommendation, if you are going for a proper mouse or a keyboard, go with Razer (I cant speak for other products as I havent tried anything from other manufacturers).

  I placed an order for an MX Master 3 mouse and heard nothing for five days. They have no customer service line so you have to ask their community board or call technical support for answers. Technical support found that the product was not in stock and would take a couple days. Their website continued listing the item as ""in stock"" potentially defrauding more customers. After not hearing back again, I asked for a refund, which was had to be forwarded to review, again they are not reachable by phone. Two weeks after placing my order and a week after cancelling it, I received shipping notification for the now cancelled order. I had to again call the technical support line, was promised an answer within the day, and then found out that they would have to recall the shipment, and would only issue a refund once they received the item they mistakenly shipped because they could not process a cancellation in time. I'm not sure who handles their customer service and ordering system but it's an absolute crime how poorly they handled this.

I searched and couldn’t figure it out though so I contacted Logitech to ask before taking all the steps to file a claim.

  Bought a Logitech G430. Geat headset, very strong, great quality, great sound, great bass, breathes, comfortable... BUT, there is an issue that Logitech has decided to ignore, despite this issue appearing around 2014-2015: The driver causes the sound to reverse randomly when using the headset which makes it impossible to use to play because there is no way to fix this, and in certain sound location is very important. So Logitech is closing their eyes on this like we would just buy a new headset. And this is issue that makes this headset unusable will never be fixed because they don't care. Before gaming was a trend, they made the best equipment regarding PC, no flaws. But now they decided to go cheap and full profit. They disgust me, such an issue on a $80 headest that they KEEP SELLING is unacceptable. Go MadCatz guys, I've own a MadCatz RAT3 for 7 years no issue.

  I bought a Logitech M720 Triathlon, it is a fantastic mouse and it tick all the boxes I needed for work, but it came with an unbalanced scrolling wheel, which seemed like a common problem a lot of other people reported. I contact Logitech support in May, 2019, and they asked me to request a replacement through my vendor (Amazon), and if the problem persisted, they would step in. Amazon replaced my product immediately but it had the exact same issue. I contacted Logitech again and they have been giving me the runaround for almost 3 months now. They keep asking me to run ridiculous tests like replacing batteries and reinstalling software (on a physical problem, unbalanced scrolling wheel), changing my customer reps, giving me different case numbers, and asking me to re-explain the problem even though I am replying to the same e-mail and referencing all case numbers I've received. The last e-mail I received was on August 13th and they said ""[...]this will be pending for approval and we will keep you updated within the next 24-48 hours."" It is now August 19th, I have followed up twice asking for updates, and my customer rep has gone silent. Logitech makes fantastic products, but don't expect them to honor any warranties.

  This has to be the worst customer service I have experienced - they simply won't respond! Many of the keys on my brand-new keyboard stopped working immediately after starting to use it. Looking at forum messages, it is clear that this is a common problem and not specific to me. After a long time debating the issue with Logitech Customer Support, they sent me out a new one: it had exactly the same problem! I know it is a problem with the product and not my device, because I have tested it on multiple devices. For 6 months now I have been trying to get a refund, but am being stalled and ignored by Logitech Customer Support - despite them actually agreeing to send me a refund, I simply can't get them to actually do this!

  I was trying to replace a USB connector for a Power Plus M525 mouse, which was missing from the package when I bought it. I was unable to open an account online because the “send confirmation email” button was not working. Then I tried the tech support bot, which was entirely useless, as was the automated telephone answering service (which required me to respond to each question 3 (three) times before going on to the next question. I am giving up and will purchase another mouse from another company.

  This has honestly been the worst customer service experience I've had. It initially started out fine. I purchased a mouse/keyboard combo and I needed a replacement mouse. It took about a month of back and forth to get what I needed but ultimately they sent me a replacement and I was satisfied. I then received a bill from the shipping company. And they've since changed their ticketing system. I have had no luck getting a hold of anyone there and I keep receiving the same automated messages. The first says they're waiting for me to reply to keep the case open, which I have done four times. The second says my case is updated and comes from Erma. Also received four times.  No response, no resolution for over two weeks.

  I bought an MX Master mouse. it's supposed to be good, and it is. But the control software logitech options is the worst piece of software I've yet to encounter. Took ages to actually make it install. Then it will not let me create an account or log in to one i created on the webpage. I had to install an old version which I in turn HAVE to open MANUALLY every time if I want my custom settings to work. This has however updated to the latest version automatically now which is still NOT working. Finish your damned products before you sell them.

  I've got several Circle 2 cameras at home and one failed after more than a year. It suddenly lost its connection to the cloud. My experience is different than many of yours was. I contacted customer support through their online report submission page not expecting much, mainly because I thought the camera was out of warranty. They responded after a few days and then stuck with me while we tried to sort out what was wrong. They agreed that it was a hardware issue with the camera and are sending me a replacement. Once they were in touch the issue was resolved in about 2 days. BTW the Circle 2 is performing well for me as a security camera.

  I don’t usually pile on, but yea, they suck. Two out of two KB/mouse sets were inop right out of the box and had to be returned. There is no support, I got an email with unhelpful info 10 days after asking. Much as Microsoft stinks, they do make a reliable kB/mouse set. Costs more, but at least it works.

  I am only giving Logitech 1 star because there is no way to give them none. Logitech has consistently the WORST products and support ""services"" I have EVER seen. First, the mouse i have form them stops working. The Day i got it. Ever since, the past 6+ months, I have been making occasional posts on Logitech.com. However, their support is inactive, and I have gotten 0 help from ANYONE at Logitech. I have seen hundreds of other posts with either NO help similar to mine or the standard copy-pasted answer that doesn't help at all. I have also seen reports of horrendous shipping times, although I have not experienced this firsthand as I bought my product in-store.

  I have only given Logitech 1 star, because there isn't an option to give minus stars. I have NEVER had such poor service from ANY company ordering online until dealing with this company. I ordered two items, one on 19 June, one on 20 June. The first item was supposed to be delivered today, now it is to be delivered tomorrow, but when is unknown. I cannot notify them of delivery instructions after speaking to them on the phone, as my delivery is still in transit! The second item whereabouts is unknown. When I go to check whereabouts, according to their webpage when I log into my account, there is only the 1st item to expect. This despite money being taken from my account for both items.. I have no confidence in this company now, whatsoever, and wish I had believed the negative reviews I have seen from other customers. I have given up trying to speak to anyone on the phone, as there is always ""no-one available to take your call at this extension, please leave a message"". When I follow email links from their own emails, I get the webpage message on the Logitech site ""Oops, this page doesn't seem to exist"", or similar wording.

  Their warranty department is amazing. They have been very easy with me for warranty, sometimes even when it is out of warranty, they cover it if it is a factory defect or common fault. Just a few emails back and forth confirming that it is a faulty unit, and they instantly send out a new unit. If they stop making that unit, they will give you the next equivalent newer model. Basically, although they don't always have the most durable product, their customer service really makes up for that.

  My G403 mouse experienced a common scroll wheel issue after about 6 months. I contact support and they authorised a replacement really quickly. So far so good. The mouse was dispatched within a week of my first support ticket being raised. The mouse was not delivered by the delivery company. They stated it was left by my back door, I don’t even have a back door so something fishy going on there. This is when it went downhill. I had to make multiple calls to Logitech and the delivery company. It took about 2 weeks for delivery company to admit it was missing, Logitech were informed of the same and yet it took another 2 months before a replacement was sent. I sent numerous emails to Logitech most of which were ignored. I asked them to call me, and nothing, I was told y ticket was escalated, and nothing happened. I would email almost daily, and no response. I must have received about 5 or 6 emails in that time asking if my issue was resolved so they can close the call. I would replay and say no it isn’t because you haven’t done anything, and get no response. When they do reply they lie, but most of the time you don’t get a response. Avoid this company at all costs

  About 2 weeks ago the ""w"" key stopped working on my Logitech K800 keyboard. I have had this keyboard about 2.25 years and it has exceeded my expectations up until the issue. I registered this keyboard with Logitech support back when I originally purchased it. I noticed there was a 3 year, limited warranty so I contacted Logitech Customer Support and explained my problem. Within a couple of days I received a response from Angelica who was assigned my case. She sent me a list of things to do as a work-around to test for restoration of full functionality as well as a request to confirm my mailing address. None of the things worked so I let her know. One of the items on the list was to download the unifying wireless software so I could use multiple devices through a single fob/USB port - I didn't realize I could do this - it freed up a port on my laptop because my Logitech mouse can be combined with the keyboard on a single fob. I let Angelica know that none of the tasks on the list restored the key function and she immediately responded to let me know that Logitech was sending me a new, replacement keyboard. I did not have to return the broken one. I received the new keyboard today. So - this entire transaction took only about 2 weeks.I am so impressed with this company.

  Logitech G560 Speakers look good sound ok but DO NOT BUY THEM! The software is totally useless and I suspect the firmware has problems, Logitech are aware of the problems but do nothing about it. The volume can not be controlled at low levels on any input, impossible to use at night as every input is too loud. When you turn them on there is no sound, you have to randomly click on anything in the software to make them come on, and when they do it's at full volume. You can not choose what input plays, the software control for this is hidden and when you do find it, it won't work. Simply useless and over complicated software, and firmware that can not control the volume. Logitech are a big company with huge profits, you would think they could afford to pay for an I.T. department that can make a pair of speakers work properly.

  CAUTION NOT TO BUY: Logitech K480 Keyboard PROBLEMS: * Bluetooth ONLY (BT) * BT ONLY works within an operating system, so if anything happens to the operating system, the keyboard will NOT work. * You can NOT access BIOS with BT. * You can NOT dual boot to select an operating system with BT. * You can NOT install an operating system with BT. * BT has constant drop outs, lags, needing to pair to work. * Your BT devices MIGHT be seen by your neighbors, who MIGHT be able access such.  I returned the K480, which has excellent built quality, and exchanged it for the K780 which has WiFi and BT, and is fully functional. Avoid the K480 and buy the K780 ... unless you want endless frustration. Logitech is an excellent computer hardware company, that at times make mistakes, like the K480 being Bluetooth only. ... Bluetooth - this is a technology which should not exist, because of the inherent limitations. Avoid BT or be prepared to be frustrated endlessly.

I contacted Logitech support asking for advise what I can do. In the beginning the support was quite frustrating because they just sent me templates which haven't matched my request properly.  After some mails the support understood my struggle and thankfully they were able to help me.  All in all I'm a super happy customer for ages now and would always recommend purchasing a Logitech product! Thanks Logitech!

  They allowed the support of many of their TV web cameras to be deactivated by Microsoft, and they didn't offer any alternative solution's. So we're stuck with perfectly working camera that won't work for anything now simply because of support issues. What a joke of a company. They decide how long our product will last, and then they really expect me to go out and buy another of their cameras to replace my previous one. really?

  I just want to cancel my order before it is shipped. All of the phones numbers are unavailable at this time and it is so difficult to navigate and use the forums. I don't even know how to post anything and googling how to yields no results. I sent a support ticket (I think, their entire support page is confusing. I clicked on the category to help me with online orders and then it asks for me to type in the serial number of the mouse that I have yet to receive). This entire experience has been horrible and I will never buy off their website again.

  Brand new keyboard with 4 year battery came with only 80% charge. Customer support directed me to buy a new battery and replace it. When I suggested they mail me a new battery they refused and suggested I return the keyboard to the store. Was going to buy UE speakers until I found out they area also made by Logitech.

  Bought a c922 webcam, no support. No software. Not even comparable to the c270 I had in terms of ability to use. I commented on their forums on like minded posts, and found they had banned me from commenting. Instead of even responding to my open case, they banned me. Terrible company. Best to avoid, and I do not recommend the c922 webcam, it is only supported in OBS at the specified details. Otherwise, you have a run of the mill webcam, that costs 3 times as much as one for the same specs, elsewhere.

  Really Great Quality Products! I have multiple products from Logitech but I am mostly happy with there mice it is just amazing and really great to use. They are also really affordable. But sadly their webcams were not that great I had some terrible experiences with one of my webcams and it just broke without any reason.

  Stay away. yes the marketing is very nice, but the support is simply a myth. Their TV cam stopped working and they only propose to send you a basic webcam. A 20$ piece of crap for a 200+$ TV cam. The most interesting is that you can not talk to them over the phone and their support web refuses you submit a ticket for this device. Again, they are plenty of interesting and cheaper alternatives to this company. Take your time and avoid them.

  Again, another company that does not give a s+=t! I have a mouse that has lasted 14 months until the receiver stopped working. I emailed to ask whether there was a solution to fix this. After 2 weeks, I have got nowhere but the bloke (boglarka) just asked the same questions over and over again. The mouse is fine the receiver doesn't connect. 4 emails later. Please provide receipt of where the product was bought and when. I emailed this! These have a 2 year warranty. To be told it's out of warranty because the shop had either sold me old stock or they can't be bothered to replace a £20 mouse. Absolutely terrible.

  This is the first time I have ever written a review online, and the reason being logitech's after services is appalling, trying to claim a warranty over the z906 speakers for over a month now, and it's pretty much the WORST experience I have ever had to go through, I was asked to send basically everything, started off with proof of purchase, then oh you need to send us a picture of the serial number with a note of my claim number next to it, as if that wasn't enough, we need a video now of you explaining what was wrong with it, considering these speakers weigh a tonne, so taking it in and out of the box was a right pain. Only for them to ask me to re-pack the speakers and send it to the Netherlands. It's been 3 weeks now, haven't heard nothing since, tracking indicated speakers were delivered within 2 days of sending it. Yet nothing. Rubbish company

  I love my G13 keyboard and my G402 mouse. I really like the Logitech Gaming Software v8.96 these run under.  So I decided to buy the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick, thinking that it would also run under the Logitech Gaming Software v8.96, as per the mouse and keyboard. The version that the joystick (and all the joysticks that Logitech currently manufacture, currently advertise and currently sell) is the Logitech Gaming Software v5.10. This version was the same software as the keyboard/mouse software but one that hasn't been updated since June 2010, meaning that you must run two different versions of the same software if you have a joystick and mouse/keyboard by Logitech. And as the v5.10 has not been updated since Windows 7, Logitech can not even guarantee that this version will be safe to run under Windows 10. Their customer service is some of the worst I have experienced, using lies and excuses to do nothing to help customers and refusing to apolgise for their mistakes, lies, excuses, terrible turnaround times etc. Will I be purchasing more Logitech products? No, not even if Logitech where the last peripheral manufacture on the planet, not even if I was given the products for free.

  My love hate relationship with Logitech. I love their products, mice and software in particular. I have an ongoing issue though with the quality as there is always either a double click issue or a failing spring (won't hold down even when pressed) in the right or left or both click buttons. I try to get my warranty honoured and indeed it was once and I did get a replacement but the work that went into getting it was such that I could probably have earned more from an employer and bought another mouse. I have the same issue again, and I have just bought another Logitech mouse to replace it. I am putting in the warranty claim again but haven't heard anything in nearly 2 weeks. I am not holding out much hope of a replacement. So, as it is now, I average about £8 per month for mice from Logitech if you break it down into a bill, which it is really. Once I find another manufacturer whos mice are as nice to use and with the simple configuration software, Logitech won't sell me any more products.

                Beware if anything goes wrong with your product. Refrigerators are NOT built to last. My 5 year and 4 month old American Style Fridge freezer catastrophically failed. Fridges are supposed to last at least 10-20 years. Samsung refused to replace it despite it being marginally over the 5 year mark. There were multiple cracks in the carcass behind the coolant where you cannot see until it is too late. Samsung service was appalling. Says so much about the quality of their fridges, their appreciation for their customers, their acknowledgment that cracking in the carcass at 5 years is not right, and their respect for the environment while violating up to 5 of the UN Sustainable Development goals it claims it fulfills on its website. This huge fridge, with all its plastic will now go to landfill while leaving a customer in the lurch in the middle of a pandemic.

                I really believe Samsung should win awards for their lies and excuses as to why it’s not covered under the warranty? This is my second Samsung galaxy phone and I will never use Samsung again, In October 2019 I up graded from Galaxy s8 to Galaxy note 10 lovely looking phone good features but being glass it is fragile so for this reason from day 1 I put it in a genuine Samsung wallet £45 not cheap and also paid an extra £30 to have a screen protector fitted in store. In April 2020 whilst using my phone still in mint condition the volume button became unattached and how I found out that Samsung will not honour their warranty. I phoned customer services to be told “that’s not covered under warranty it’s physical damage” ? As I explained I had researched the problem on line and found it has happened to a few phones so it must be a manufacturing fault? Customer service response “I’ll send a courier to pick it up and the engineer can decide” confident that in mint condition and not having any physical damage it would be repaired? WRONG I got an email saying they had received my device followed by an email saying it’s not covered under warranty and it would cost me £219 to mend the broken screen? I immediately phoned customer service to question this Stating I have taken photos the courier driver took photos there wasn’t any mark on the phone when it left my house. Customer service “ I phoned the engineer the screen is cracked top left hand corner so not covered under warranty” Arguing my case it was fine when the courier driver took it. I was supposedly escalated to customer solutions? Who informed me it did have a cracked screen And because of this it wasn’t covered under warranty and they would send me pictures showing this today ( never arrived) and contact the courier for his pictures, A Few days later I phoned to find out what was happening no one knew? Then I received an email to say it didn’t have a cracked screen? What the engineer meant ( after naming crack top left hand corner) was that his words “ The volume button sits on the screen off the phone? So to replace the volume button the full screen will need to be replaced” So they would class this as physical damage and chargeable and their engineers will not make any necessary repairs until payment is received. Basically you don’t have a warranty with Samsung I urge anyone with a dispute to contact trading standards reading the reviews something needs to be done and hopefully with enough complaints they will look into Samsung warranties

                I bought a monitor from their online shop. The monitor was not delivered. There has been no refund and their Philippines based customer service centre is hopeless.  Since I can show that my monitor never left the Samsung warehouse and I have nothing to show for my money, I assumed a refund would be straight forward and not involve a claim through PayPal. I was wrong and I have been forced to start a case.  I - along with most reviewers here - regret having dealt with this company. It has been an awful experience.

                Samsung is the worst company I have ever worked with. Their customer service is terrible. I usually don't bother writing reviews, and I am usually not one to complain, but Samsung is so terrible that I thought I should warn others against using them. I got a Galaxy A10E (a terrible, terrible phone) through them and it has not worked since I got it. It does not receive text messages, a basic function that should work. I have sent my phone in four times, but each time they have just sent me back my original phone with no fixes, even though they have told me multiple times that they would send me a replacement/my money back. Those in customer service are very poorly trained and depending on the person I have talk to, downright rude. DO NOT USE SAMSUNG!!!!

                I have ALWAYS sworn by Samsung products and have a house full of them. So of course I decided to order my son a laptop. Due to the virus his senior year has pretty much been a disaster and he just wants it over with. I originally had the laptop going to Texas since thats where he's at. He had the option of coming to Utah and getting his diploma done sooner so that's what we're doing. Laptop won't actually ship for another 2 weeks and they won't allow me to change the shipping address. So the computer will get to Texas the day he leaves to come to Utah and customer service just tells me ""oh well"". Either cancel and reorder (which will take another month) or pay more money to have it sent from Texas to Utah. Your service is horrible and with the way things are right now you would think they could work around that. I was going to order a few more things from them but probably not now.

                I purchased a Samsung tumble dryer DV90H8000HW in 2017, having just passed the 3 year mark it has developed a HE fault, a Heating Error!  Having purchased the product with a 5 year warranty I was very dissatisfied to know upon calling Samsung that the warranty had expired late November 2018!! How was this possible? Well, the lady I spoke to said the product came with a two year warranty and in order to qualify for the 5 year warranty I needed to register for it within 90 days of purchase! apparently the supplier had the responsibility of advising me of this! (How does the period of time from 2017 to 2018 total two years?) Samsung are not prepared to honour the 5 year warranty and can only provide me with an engineer at my own expense, or a 25% discount voucher for me to purchase a replacement item. Having advised the Manager that I spoke to on the phone how dissatisfied I was with the outcome of having been provided with a faulty product I then requested an email address to provide feedback to their customer services team. I was reassured that this  would be sent to me via email along with the discount code if I chose to use this,  four days later I still await this!!    3 years use out of a top end dryer surely this is not acceptable Samsung!! Previous budget dryer lasted in excess of 15 years but as you were offering a bigger drum size, and better specs I thought I'd give it a try, big mistake! The fact that you are also unwilling to accept that this unsuitable it also quite appalling.

                As a former Samsung employee. The customer service is awful and not enough is invested in this. But I have met the Samsung team in Soul and this would disgust them. As they are about customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, I believe the UK faction is letting them down. However having worked mostly with John Lewis stores, I recommend them for their customer service if anything goes wrong so I would recommend buying any electronic products from John Lewis. John lewis match most prices in the market as well but with exceptional services. Forgot to mention that the products are excellent but you expect support when sh** goes wrong.

                Beware if anything goes wrong with your product. Refrigerators are NOT built to last. My 5 year and 4 month old American Style Fridge freezer catastrophically failed. Fridges are supposed to last at least 10-20 years. Samsung refused to replace it despite it being marginally over the 5 year mark. There were multiple cracks in the carcass behind the coolant where you cannot see until it is too late. Samsung service was appalling. Says so much about the quality of their fridges, their appreciation for their customers, their acknowledgment that cracking in the carcass at 5 years is not right, and their respect for the environment while violating up to 5 of the UN Sustainable Development goals it claims it fulfills on its website. This huge fridge, with all its plastic will now go to landfill while leaving a customer in the lurch in the middle of a pandemic.

                I really believe Samsung should win awards for their lies and excuses as to why it’s not covered under the warranty? This is my second Samsung galaxy phone and I will never use Samsung again, In October 2019 I up graded from Galaxy s8 to Galaxy note 10 lovely looking phone good features but being glass it is fragile so for this reason from day 1 I put it in a genuine Samsung wallet £45 not cheap and also paid an extra £30 to have a screen protector fitted in store. In April 2020 whilst using my phone still in mint condition the volume button became unattached and how I found out that Samsung will not honour their warranty. I phoned customer services to be told “that’s not covered under warranty it’s physical damage” ? As I explained I had researched the problem on line and found it has happened to a few phones so it must be a manufacturing fault? Customer service response “I’ll send a courier to pick it up and the engineer can decide” confident that in mint condition and not having any physical damage it would be repaired? WRONG I got an email saying they had received my device followed by an email saying it’s not covered under warranty and it would cost me £219 to mend the broken screen? I immediately phoned customer service to question this Stating I have taken photos the courier driver took photos there wasn’t any mark on the phone when it left my house. Customer service “ I phoned the engineer the screen is cracked top left hand corner so not covered under warranty” Arguing my case it was fine when the courier driver took it. I was supposedly escalated to customer solutions? Who informed me it did have a cracked screen And because of this it wasn’t covered under warranty and they would send me pictures showing this today ( never arrived) and contact the courier for his pictures, A Few days later I phoned to find out what was happening no one knew? Then I received an email to say it didn’t have a cracked screen? What the engineer meant ( after naming crack top left hand corner) was that his words “ The volume button sits on the screen off the phone? So to replace the volume button the full screen will need to be replaced” So they would class this as physical damage and chargeable and their engineers will not make any necessary repairs until payment is received. Basically you don’t have a warranty with Samsung I urge anyone with a dispute to contact trading standards reading the reviews something needs to be done and hopefully with enough complaints they will look into Samsung warranties

                I bought a monitor from their online shop. The monitor was not delivered. There has been no refund and their Philippines based customer service centre is hopeless.  Since I can show that my monitor never left the Samsung warehouse and I have nothing to show for my money, I assumed a refund would be straight forward and not involve a claim through PayPal. I was wrong and I have been forced to start a case.  I - along with most reviewers here - regret having dealt with this company. It has been an awful experience.

I was very courteous and sent them all documents they asked for proving it was only 3 months old when problem first occurred. Then I get an email stating that they are closing the case!

                Samsung is the worst company I have ever worked with. Their customer service is terrible. I usually don't bother writing reviews, and I am usually not one to complain, but Samsung is so terrible that I thought I should warn others against using them. I got a Galaxy A10E (a terrible, terrible phone) through them and it has not worked since I got it. It does not receive text messages, a basic function that should work. I have sent my phone in four times, but each time they have just sent me back my original phone with no fixes, even though they have told me multiple times that they would send me a replacement/my money back. Those in customer service are very poorly trained and depending on the person I have talk to, downright rude. DO NOT USE SAMSUNG!!!!

                I have ALWAYS sworn by Samsung products and have a house full of them. So of course I decided to order my son a laptop. Due to the virus his senior year has pretty much been a disaster and he just wants it over with. I originally had the laptop going to Texas since thats where he's at. He had the option of coming to Utah and getting his diploma done sooner so that's what we're doing. Laptop won't actually ship for another 2 weeks and they won't allow me to change the shipping address. So the computer will get to Texas the day he leaves to come to Utah and customer service just tells me ""oh well"". Either cancel and reorder (which will take another month) or pay more money to have it sent from Texas to Utah. Your service is horrible and with the way things are right now you would think they could work around that. I was going to order a few more things from them but probably not now. First time buying directly from Samsung. Last time.

                I purchased a Samsung tumble dryer DV90H8000HW in 2017, having just passed the 3 year mark it has developed a HE fault, a Heating Error!  Having purchased the product with a 5 year warranty I was very dissatisfied to know upon calling Samsung that the warranty had expired late November 2018!! How was this possible? Well, the lady I spoke to said the product came with a two year warranty and in order to qualify for the 5 year warranty I needed to register for it within 90 days of purchase! apparently the supplier had the responsibility of advising me of this! (How does the period of time from 2017 to 2018 total two years?) Samsung are not prepared to honour the 5 year warranty and can only provide me with an engineer at my own expense, or a 25% discount voucher for me to purchase a replacement item. Having advised the Manager that I spoke to on the phone how dissatisfied I was with the outcome of having been provided with a faulty product I then requested an email address to provide feedback to their customer services team. I was reassured that this  would be sent to me via email along with the discount code if I chose to use this,  four days later I still await this!!    3 years use out of a top end dryer surely this is not acceptable Samsung!! Previous budget dryer lasted in excess of 15 years but as you were offering a bigger drum size, and better specs I thought I'd give it a try, big mistake! The fact that you are also unwilling to accept that this unsuitable it also quite appalling.

                Actually so disgusted with this company. Forked out over £800 for a smart TV, but the money grabbing didn't stop there. There are built in ads on the smart menu bar. When the TV starts up, it automatically goes to the god awful TV plus app, really bad if you have kids as it shows ads for movies unsuitable for children. Worst of all, you cannot disable any of it whether you agree to the terms and conditions or not. I also have a galaxy watch and s10. The galaxy watch isn't compatible with the Google store, it isn't compatible with Google assistant, there are empty menus in the galaxy watch store, don't even waste your money. As for the S10+, I went from the S9 to this model, and there was barely any difference between the two. Also they forced their bixby software on you with that awful side button. Bixby is just awful, plain awful, mostly because it does not understand 90% of what you ask it and their are constant updates that improve nothing. A voice assistant that doesn't understand your voice, useful, very useful Samsung... As you can tell I HAD been a loyal customer to Samsung owning a lot of their products, but honestly I will never buy another one of theirs again. They don't care about their customers or how to improve their products for the betterment of their consumers, only their own interests and profits matter to them.

Charged me for tablet repair that I feel should have been covered by warranty - itself irritating but made infuriating by the complete lack of engagement, and lack of any way to escalate the issue to a higher level.

                We love Samsung. I am really not sure why all these people had issues with Samsung. Was it with Samsung direct you had dealings with or another retailer you bought the Samsung product from? In the last 2-3 weeks; we have bought 3no S20 phones and 2no Galaxy Active2 watches from Samsung direct, from their website. using the website was very easy and the orders were placed at different times and days. On all occasions the items arrived very quickly by DPD. We had to return 2no of the phones back at different times. We had no issues getting connected to an customer services agent. You just call the Samsung customer services number and you get an answer pretty quickly. They were very helpful and quickly arranged collection. The refund was made very quickly.  Overall, I am very happy with all my SAmsung products at home and their customer services are really helpful, their systems are working very quickly despite the virus issue. Those, who are not happy with Samsung; are you sure this is direct with Samsung or did you buy a Samsuny product via a retailer like Currys.  Before we bought any of the above, we bought a Galaxy Watch from Currys; although the delivery was pretty quick, we just could not arrange a return. We waited over two hours on the phone (Currys). Their social media pages are full of complaints.  Samsung will continue to be the leading gadget manufacturer as they are the best. We love Samsung.

                Called toll number- my tv cord was taken accidentally while I disconnected my cable service and had to send in the equipment to Direct TV. ( Not my fault!). I asked if the cord could be replaced but they would not budge as I did not have my receipt.  My son bought my tv and he longer had the receipt.

                Why people pay a premium over an Apple: ordered a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 arrived on time, but its operating system was broken and could not boot/charge. Asked for a replacement and this took forever until I had to ask for a refund after more than 10 days useless waiting.  The Samsung customer service is literally non-existent and they never realise their promise. They even have difficulty in tracking reference numbers and seem to have no recording system.  I wish I just had read the reviews here before buying Samsung. I could easily see why people love Apple. AVOID Samsung by any means. You won't believe how careless they are treating their customers. To Samsung: you will eventually pay off a good chunk of your business by continuing to undermining your customer values! Be sure.

                They don’t even deserve one star. We paid a lot of money for our fridge-freezer, the first one arrived and the ice machine didn’t work. So after many, many phone calls (no one ever calls you back when they say they will), they tried to deliver a second one which was damaged. So we rejected it, went through the rigmarole again only to have a new one delivered and the ice machine didn’t work on it. Once again, had to phone them several times and once again they tried to deliver one that was damaged. We’re still waiting on our follow up call 6 months later, it caused us so much stress we have given up. Luckily, they did an update which miraculously fixed the ice machine. I also found out, if you fill your freezer up, it stops working. Yes, you read that right, if you utilise the space that you spent thousands of pounds on, it stops the ice machine from working. Leave it 70% full and it’s fine. It’s ridiculous. They’re a total bunch of cowboys, the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. Avoid at all costs! The hassle is just not worth it!

                I wish there was a way to leave a NO star review.  I have purchased 3, yes 3 dishwashers from this pathetic company. I should have known better after the 1 time, but I tried again and when I had to have it replaced a 2nd time, I really should've learned but money was tight and I thought there was no way it could happen a 3rd time. Basically the dishwasher has a flawed design in that it doesn't drain well, and once it overflows the water goes into the door panel, fries the sensor and then the pump doesn't shut off, even when you shut the unit off, it turns back on and continues to run thereby presenting a fire hazard. The only way to get it to shut off is unplug it.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the customer service is AWFUL!! In all honesty dealing with all the customer service providers through the years they are by far the WORST! They are condescending, they placate and offer absolutely zero authentic CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Do yourself a favor and RUN from any samsung appliance unless you have lots of free time to sit on hold and wait for people to call you back or respond to emails.

                I purchased a Samsung A71 a few months ago and I am very pleased with the overall performance of this model.  Would have given 5 stars if the Samsung online shop hadn't messed about so much.  Pros Good large Screen   excellent camera Fast processor Android 10  very good Lock screen facial recognition works OK in reasonable light conditions. optional case works well with the info window  Cons Fingerprint for lock screen hardly ever works for me but oddly is fine for my wife. I purchased from the Samsung shop online who are very polite but pretty useless.if something goes wrong.  I have originally ordered an A70 which went faulty after 2 days but by the time they got round to figuring out that it was out of stock and changed to a refund 4 weeks later.  However they redeemed themselves somewhat with a generous discount on the A71

                Brought a Samsung A80 phone in Feb and although I only ever used it on a case the screen developed small scratches. These don't interfere with the use of the phone but as they are in the spot where I scroll up and down they are annoying so I contacted Samsung  and guess what ....yep they couldn't give a toss .as far as I'm concerned a touch screen phone should be able to be touched without the screen getting scratched

                I recently got a Samsung Active 2, I am very impressed with it.  Setting it up was so simple, as my phone is a Samsung it connected right away.  I also qualified for the cash back which I was sceptical about as they told me I had info missing a couple of times to claim it back even though I got it directly through the Samsung website.  I have now however received the cash back and it took less than 30 days.  Very impressed with the service and the products.  Not totally impressed with my A70 phone however I didn't get the best advice from EE when I was upgrading but that's a different story!

After a 3 week wait the fridge was inspected and the inspector confirmed that it could not be repaired. This is now coming into May and i am still waiting on Samsung replacing the fridge. I have contacted Samsung on numerous occasions &gt; 30+ times. One of the last conversations was during the NZ lock down period and although Samsung acknowledged that this was classified as an essential item they would not be delivering to me until post lockdown. I called again last week in April when the announcement was made re. dropping to level 3 and was informed that no decision had been made on delivery. I have been without a fridge throughout the lockdown and this has required that i visit the stores for food on a regular basis, which was and is counter to the government guidance and instruction.  ""we are all in this together"" clearly does not apply to Samsung in New Zealand. Terrible and uncaring service.

                Got a Samsung watch and phone from EE so was eligible for Samsung cashback.  Filled in the paperwork in time, didn't hear anything but wasn't overly worried as it said could take thirty days to veriry.  I then used their track claim and it said information was missing.  I contacted them to find out what they needed, and have just received an email saying they had emailed and sent a text message saying they needed additional information from me, but because I didn't reply within 7 days, my claim had been rejected under their terms.   This is a complete fabrication as I received no text message from them or email until I contacted them.

                I Ordered a Galaxy Buds + on April the 7th and its missing, i called Samsung customer service they said we will investigate it and get back to you.  No problem how long does the investigation take, Samsung call handler said 3-5 working days, called and emailed them a number of times, no reply whatsoever, everyone was given me different information, so I called after 9 working days and I have been told the investigation hasn't even started its pending.   So she said give me 24 hours I will get this sorted for you and ask for the manger to call me back, they said the managers working from home therefore they only communicate via email, ok no problem how long do I have to wait for your manager to email me, so another 48 hours, waited 72 hours nothing.  Then I called back they said we will get this resolved for you within the next 24 hours, still nothing after 48 hours.  Then I called back on Sunday the 19th April they please give us another 48 hours we promise we will get this sorted for you.   Called back today I was really fuming as I have wasted so much time on the phone to get though to them, and they answered still nothing apparently the manager hasn't even got back to their customer advisor who put the request through.  So I have left with no option but to dispute this case with my bank. I have already reported this to action fraud, police and trading standards. I am not gonna let them get away on how they treated me, I can not believe what a rubbish customer service nobody knows what they're doing.   I said to the advisor can I have the managers name because I am already in contact with the head office she said we can't give you our managers name and I asked can I have your name she said we can't give you our names. Unbelievable.  So please do not purchase anything from Samsung, if you have any issues the customer service horrendously terrible. They are not willing to help you and trying to get you of the phone as quickly as possible.   Avoid, avoid, avoid.

I hate that too because their products really are top of the line, but the rest of their business model sucks. 0/10 would not recommend

                Purchased a TV and sound bar which had a cashback promotion. Both delivered and installed by Samsung however due to current climate and dealing with elderly family and lockdown I was 2 days late submitting my claim in. Samsung are refusing to honour the cashback !  This is unacceptable behaviour from such a reputable firm with zero customer service!

                Never ever buy another Samsung Smart TV,they can't be bothered to add a 3.5 jack so you can listen through headphones via audio out connection,and then I purchased a Bluetooth speaker to find out my TV wouldn't pair with my Monitor Audio speaker.So it's Sony or Phillips for me from now on(looks like LG don't have a jack output either).

Second time send now they quoted £1200 and they did not even open the phone to check the faulty.  Learnt my lesson never again with any Samsung product.

                I Ordered a Galaxy Buds + on April the 7th and its missing, i called Samsung customer service they said we will investigate it and get back to you.  No problem how long does the investigation take, Samsung call handler said 3-5 working days, called and emailed them a number of times, no reply whatsoever, everyone was given me different information, so I called after 9 working days and I have been told the investigation hasn't even started its pending.   So she said give me 24 hours I will get this sorted for you and ask for the manger to call me back, they said the managers working from home therefore they only communicate via email, ok no problem how long do I have to wait for your manager to email me, so another 48 hours, waited 72 hours nothing.  Then I called back they said we will get this resolved for you within the next 24 hours, still nothing after 48 hours.  Then I called back on Sunday the 19th April they please give us another 48 hours we promise we will get this sorted for you.   Called back today I was really fuming as I have wasted so much time on the phone to get though to them, and they answered still nothing apparently the manager hasn't even got back to their customer advisor who put the request through.  So I have left with no option but to dispute this case with my bank. I have already reported this to action fraud, police and trading standards. I am not gonna let them get away on how they treated me, I can not believe what a rubbish customer service nobody knows what they're doing.   I said to the advisor can I have the managers name because I am already in contact with the head office she said we can't give you our managers name and I asked can I have your name she said we can't give you our names. Unbelievable.  So please do not purchase anything from Samsung, if you have any issues the customer service horrendously terrible. They are not willing to help you and trying to get you of the phone as quickly as possible.   Avoid, avoid, avoid.

                I sent back my tablet 5 weeks ago and they requested additional documents because they said they want to be customer focus. After facing and emailing and calling, they said they didnt receive my documents. I asked to have them send y device back and I am now working with case manager #8. It sounds like they lost it and want to replace it but they cannot replace it because of above documentation. I refuse to buy ki samsung ever again. I also purchase many for family and friends so screw Samsung. For $75 in repairs (I already prepaid), you gave up over 50k of goods over the last 2 yrs. Short sighted.

                I purchased a 65 inch Samsung    T.V. several months ago. When putting it out, everything was included in the packaging except the 4 Screws that hold the T.V. stand. I called Samsung    customer service the next day and got a total runaround. after speaking to 4 different people, the fourth person said he would mail out the screws. Months went by and no screws. Today I get an email from  Gwendolyn Samsung    Triage, Customer Service Dept. telling me that in order to get the screws I must email her a picture of my receipt. I have purchased 5 Samsung    T.V.'S over the past 12 years and this person wants proof of my purchase for 4 screws. first off I registered it online the day that I bought it, that's enough proof. I will NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER SAMSUNG    PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. What a horrible experience and a waste of time talking to all these people over the phone. Stay away from Samsung   , because if you need customer service you WILL NEVER GET IT.

                I ordered and paid for a TV £2799 directly from the Samsung website, when this arrived the TV was faulty and wouldn't switch on, so I called their customer service for a replacement to be sent. I was advised that they would need the return before they could issue a replacement. The TV was collected two days later by Panther Logistics (another bad company) and has been sat in the Panther warehouse for over a week. I chased this up with Samsung, who informed me that they need to receive the TV into their own warehouse from Panther, and then would need another 10 - 14 working days before a replacement was issued. I chased this with Panther and they said that it might be another 5 days before they ship the TV back to Samsung. So in all, we're looking at a month before I get a replacement (or so I thought.) I've since been informed by Samsung, that they have now sold out of this TV and they will issue me a refund (but still need to follow the above process.) Now to top it off, I've received an email this morning, informing me that they understand I need to return a TV and they will arrange collection. I can't imagine where my TV has ended up, or if I'll ever see my £2799 again.  This company is disorganised and slow at everything they do, please don't buy from them unless you can afford to throw away your hard earned cash

                I received a Samsung washing machine yesterday. Upon fitting the product it appeared to be damaged. This was notified immediately to Samsung as I’m a key worker currently employed by the ministry of defence during the Covid 19 outbreak in the uk. I require my clothes to be washed for practice as well as basic hygiene after work daily. This is an essential requirement.  After discussion via messenger I was told the process was under way however I was trying get across urgency of the current situation as I don’t have means to wash my clothes without exposing my self and family to unnecessary risk. I made a follow up phone call to the customer service team this afternoon for a time frame and also clarification on the situation. The member of staff I was put through to ‘Mel’ began to laugh at me over the phone during the conversation. I find the product, service and customer service wholy unacceptable especially during this time of crisis. I am therefore requsting a full refund of the cost of goods and would not recommend Samsung to anyone. Shambles.

                DO NOT PURCHASE SAMSUNG.  They do not care when things go wrong, they just try and brush you under the carpet.  They do not reply to you, they do not follow up, they do not chase up but they are very very good at telling lies and making excuses after they have failed to do their job and try and make it sound like it was your fault.  All they want is cash in the bank, once they have sold you a product then they are just not interested in you anymore.  Have you also noticed they do not respond to these reviews? I wonder why?

How can any manufacturer sell a premium TV in the U.K. without BBC iPlayer, and have the cheek to call it a Smart TV? Have since returned it and bought an LG at 30% less and more features. This was to replace a 4 year old Samsung TV that keeps turning itself on/off at start up, so can’t be used.

                Bought so called Samsung ""sim free"" mobile phones from Argos  ( 2x  A10 32gb ) only to realise that  they were NOT as Sim free as claimed by Samsung. For a rather weird reasons Samsung claimed that the phones were regionally locked to protect ""Unauthorised sales"" Only God knows what they meant by that!!. phones were manufactured to be sold globally anyway, does that mean Samsung  sells  different quality of their  products to different countries or regions or what? Any way that is not even the point. requested unlock codes for the 2 phones to be used outside EU, it has taken forever for Samsung to send the unlock codes after requested purchase receipt, serial and IMEI numbers of phones were sent to them over a month. Their disjointed Customer service keeps sending confused and out of sync emails all writing gibberish echoing the same message ""your query has been escalated"". it's now getting to two months, on every enquiry the response is always the same. Samsung never seems to get anything  right these days, no wonder they are losing their customers  big time to Huawei.

                SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH ACTIVE 2 (BLUETOOTH)  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY THIS WATCH!  I Bought this watch as a student (Bare in mind, money is tight) a few months ago and it was absolutely fine until the strap broke a few days ago. I contacted Samsung support and they sent it away. (Which I thought was stupid as they could have just sent me a new strap) anyway it arrived back and lo and behold the watch came back in the exact same state only to have been factory reset (which was just a waste of time for everyone). I then contacted Samsung Support again and they came out with the usual jargon of ""Warranty is void"" even though the order sheet I received when I got the watch back claimed that my watch was in ""Full Warranty"". So as you can probably tell, I'm not too happy and will NOT be purchasing another watch from Samsung nor another strap and will instead be purchasing a Fitbit as my next smart watch as their support is far more useful, not the mention the fact that they actually want to help, unlike Samsung. So my advice for you if you're thinking of purchasing this watch, DON'T DO IT! Save yourself the torture and just buy a Garmin or a Fitbit for half the price. Once again thanks to Samsung for the lack of help. :)

I spent nearly £1,800 on the two items.  I bought the tv in store at my local Curry’s. Because Curry’s didn’t have a decent soundbar in store, I immediately went home and ordered one online- again through Curry’s.  Now, because apparently I didn’t purchase the tv and soundbar together, even though it’s the same supplier and just a few hrs apart, they have refused my claim!

I’ve reported this and am now being fobbed off and told that I didn’t register to extend my warranty from two years. When I look at my purchase from AO.com and my receipt it simply displays the 5 year warranty and no mention of having to apply for this, but Samsung are using it as an excuse not to repair it.   So in these time of facing financial difficulty and when we need to shop as little as possible (which requires a working fridge and freezer) I am left with no fridge freezer and no support from Samsung.

Iâ€™ve reported this and am now being fobbed off and told that I didnâ€™t register to extend my warranty from two years. When I look at my purchase from AO.com and my receipt it simply displays the 5 year warranty and no mention of having to apply for this, but Samsung are using it as an excuse not to repair it.   So in these time of facing financial difficulty and when we need to shop as little as possible (which requires a working fridge and freezer) I am left with no fridge freezer and no support from Samsung.   Unacceptable for such a large company who should be looking after their loyal customers right now.   Thank you Samsung.

                If I could give zero stars I would. Our new s20 would not connect to a network and we have spent literally over 10 hours on live chat and phone calls getting no where. The transfer us every few minutes to someone else. I have never experienced such consistency in terrible customer service.

                I was really looking forward to the latest Galaxy phone release until I heard that, yet again in the UK, it will feature the inferior exynos chipset.  It costs less to manufacture for Samsung but they do not pass the saving onto their customers.  I will therefore no longer buy a Samsung phone until they either a) Make the chip on par with the Snapdragon or b) put the same snapdragon chip in worldwide! I will be spending my £££ on something else!

                I ordered cell phone ultra 20 on March 21. They sent me shipping date 2x. Phone never arrived. I called several times. Rep put it on escalation. Nobody in warehouse answered. Reps dont care. VPs hiding and care less. Rep told me to cancel my order and buy phone somewhere else. May as well put statues in customer service. So no phone and no status. Samsung does not care. Been an advocate for years. It's time for a change. Samsung does not care for its customers.

                Tried to contact Samsung Smart Things for a replacement of their ""SmartThings"" Button. Live Chat transferred me to a wrong live chat department which transferred me back to the same agent before who eventually told me to call Samsung Smart Things. Then the Smart Things person told me he only deals with tech support and not warranty (while the voice recording says warranty info) and then he transferred me to 3 different people who didn't know what they were doing. One person didn't even know what a ""Smart Things"" button was and I had to offer him to google the model number. After I gave him the model number he still didn't know what it was.   I think Samsung should probably rename their products dumb things.   NEVER BUY FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN.

This week samsung emailed me to say phone faulty it has what they call screen burn, i dispute this as as stated was sent in perfect condition they are now asking for £100 which i think is disgraceful,i contacted samsung to say my S9 was still under warranty to which i was told this problem not covered, i think its just one big scam from sansung and i won't  use them or recommend them again,i also tried to reason with them also due to covid 19 i have no income at minute but they didnt care.

                Nothing they do is as promised. Write a review on samsung.com, you click on it, no reviews can be given. I bought a ssd, seems a faulty one when working with mac. You get a free headphone when you buy a samsung ssd. But you have to full in 6 pages of questions, wait for two weeks and then another six weeks till the headphone arrives. And that's what they state themselves.  Why not give the headphone immediately? I hope I will receive it one day. Last thing I bought from samsung.

                I ordered a Samsung washer and dryer from home Depot, but washer was leaking the day I got it. When I called for replacement or asking a technician to come over to check out the machine. It took forever to get in touch with someone. Even I was able to talk to someone, I kept getting disconnected and I have to call them back again and again. I have been repeating this process for a week now. It's very frustrating and the issue hasn't got resolved and none of the representative was able to help. I can't believe I have to deal with this whole thing in order to find out what I can do with a new washer that was leaking the first day I got it! (The washer model# is WF45R6100AW/US). Btw, the dryer's door was broken as well when it first got delivered but fortunately it got replaced.   Also, I think there is a really bad communication between home Depot and Samsung because I can't get this issue addressed to home Depot directly, that's why I have to call the Samsung myself. And I'm talking about we reported the leaking problem literally the day we got the machine.  My advice, try to avoid purchasing big items like home appliances from home Depot and if they are Samsung.

I pre ordered the s20 ultra to get the earbuds, but I forgot to apply the employee discount. I tried to explain this to them, but they say it can't be applied to the previous order and I need to send back the already delivered phone and order a new one and then I won't get the earbuds.

                Samsung RS50N3513WW RS3000 with Plumbed Water &amp; Ice American fridge freezer This Product is expensive so you would expect it to work. It apparently has a common fault to do with a build up of ice causing the fan to become noisy, I mean NOISY. It was repaired last year 6 months after purchase. but went again 3 weeks ago. After reporting it, it took a week for an engineer to call out,He arrived took one look and said it needs new parts (an upgrade) . that took another week !. A week later the engineer fitted the new parts, left, and with in 10 minutes the noise came back.  I immediately called the engineer who couldn't call back. I then called samsung, its been another week. Apparently they are not taking calls only internet chat due to the virus?. After I finally got through I now have to wait another week before an engineer can call out. To make matters worse my wife is a Nurse, she is unable to sleep properly so is helping fight against the virus with little sleep....................thank you samsung for your poor service over the last 4 weeks.

I contacted Samsung and they had said I can get a replacement they booked a collection for my device and nobody came to collect it, which wasted all my time for that day. I had then decided to drop it off at the pickup stores and once Samsung record my s20 they cancelled the replacement device I was supposed to receive even though I was told by an advisor that the replacement was ready to ship as soon as they received the faulty device. I contacted Samsung over a hundred times using different methods and got no where. Not a single person at Samsung could tell me why it was cancelled until I went through ceo channel and heard it was cancelled because it was out of stock. Also, now it has been over 1week for me without a phone. Samsung don’t seem to care I asked them to send any s20 or the ultra I am happy with it to pay. But they can’t do that. Also, they said they will refund me which they still have not done and to top it off they have my s8 which they said they will try to get back for me and they will contact. Which they have not. Samsung shop staff ok the phone are really incompetent and really don’t know what they are doing as this is a simple problem they have made it 10x worse themselves.

To top it off I called Samsung today to tell them about this and I was speaking was speaking to a James and I told him we both spoke previously which he denied, but I’m not stupid Samsung I can tel he was the same advisor by his voice and he did also slip up saying we did speak and he then cut the phone by telling me he was putting me on hold. Also, Samsung are so incompetent that they have sent me an email for a return of my s20 when they have already received the s20.

                I saw that Samsung were offering £100 off a new S10 when you trade in a Galaxy S7 (based on good condition, which it is), so I went for it. Three weeks into owning my S10, I received an email from Samsung saying I had to pay a £50 fee as my S7 had screen burn, which is half of the trade in value gone. I have pictures of the S7 taken right before I packed it up to be sent off, and no screen burn can be seen in these pictures, but the best I've had from Samsung is ""You can have your S7 back for £100"".  This feels like such a shoddy sales tactic to me, to offer people a good trade in price to get them to commit to the purchase of a new phone, only to refuse to honour that trade in price down the line and try to impose a fee. Be very careful if you use their trade in service. I'm done with Samsung.

                Pre ordered 2 s20+ phones and clear view covers on 15th Feb with delivery expected to be 10th March.  On delivery package arrived by DPD and I signed for it not knowing the contents.  When opened we had oly received 1 phone and 1 cover in the box and note said 2 packages so then began the arduous process of getting Samsung to understand our situation as we kept getting in various messages the the order had been delivered that there seem to be some suspicion that we were on it.  Finally they accepted that the other half of the order was missing and they would have to investigate it and then yesterday we got a message to say that the phone and cover would be returned to stock and we would get a refund. Fine i thought but no explanation of what had happened and the suspicion was off us.  Refund happened so I reordered a replacement which came this morning and on opening the box found it had a damaged screen so whole return process started again.  Very angry at the moment for such poor service.

                Very bad customer service and no customer care policy at Westfield Stratford Samsung Store. I gave my phone for repair and I was told it would be ready the next day maximum. However, I kept calling every day - no one bothered to update me on why my phone was not ready. After 5 days when I called they said it was ready for collection.

                After years of buying Sony I was seduced into a curved screen tv. I went for the best with 3D. Four years the back light has gone and it went onto the repair shop on Tuesday under the 6 year warranty. After two days I’m told it will be fixed but they need authority to do so but on following this up I am told the screen is no longer available so great news I will be offered a new tv. However 5he replacement will take 4 to 6 weeks. I ring them up and it’s all my fault as I agreed to the terms and conditions. I ask for sight of these conditions and how I agreed and that is refused. I’m told they have agreed to replace but the offer of replacement will take 3 to 5 working days. How can it take that long? I’m an old fellow and staying indoors to avoid this renegade virus and without my television it seems interminable. They refuse to supply a loan tv and really don’t care. I this a truly awful customer care as their product failed within a very short time being very poorly made. However I have to carry the loss as I was stupid enough to believe their marketing

                I will never purchase anything from Samsung again. I purchased a entire kitchen appliances setup. My cooktop was not the correct cooktop I ordered. Samsung wouldn't honor their mistake. They accepted that they delivered the incorrect item, but they refuse to resend the correct item because they said the date was past time. I explained to them the reason being that I bought the bundle early for my builder would have everything in place when he was ready to install.  Once he installed I visited the site and immediately noticed it was the wrong item. I called Samsung and 1 customer service gentlemen said he would rectify the mistake and send the correct item. The item was on back order so he say. I called back several times about the ETA of the cooktop. They then say its past the return time. So I went back and forth with several supervisors. They all are horrible and unprofessional.  My household has 6 Samsung phones. All will be turned in to Verizon and Sprint today. And we will use APPLE from this day forth. As for our basement and guest quarters. We will not use any Samsung Appliances.  I wanted all Samsung. But as of today we will use any other brand. That's a total of 16 Appliances that was going to be Samsung but not anymore. I also will make sure I share with everyone not to use Samsung anything.  If they ask I will make sure they read all the reviews.

                I saw that Samsung were offering £100 off a new S10 when you trade in a Galaxy S7 (based on good condition, which it is), so I went for it. Three weeks into owning my S10, I received an email from Samsung saying I had to pay a £50 fee as my S7 had screen burn, which is half of the trade in value gone. I have pictures of the S7 taken right before I packed it up to be sent off, and no screen burn can be seen in these pictures, but the best I've had from Samsung is ""You can have your S7 back for £100"".  This feels like such a shoddy sales tactic to me, to offer people a good trade in price to get them to commit to the purchase of a new phone, only to refuse to honour that trade in price down the line and try to impose a fee. Be very careful if you use their trade in service. I'm done with Samsung.

Had a runaround between the technical and sales teams who claimed that nothing could be done after 28 days from the purchase date. I was offered a £50 voucher, which never arrived. I was left to contact Hartman/AKG, UK to see if they could help, and what a marked difference in customer service. They managed to replace the faulty item without any fuss through their MULTICARE agent. Samsung online shop is unable to offer a procedure to enable repair of an item that they don’t manufacture. Very poor customer service.

                Pre ordered 2 s20+ phones and clear view covers on 15th Feb with delivery expected to be 10th March.  On delivery package arrived by DPD and I signed for it not knowing the contents.  When opened we had oly received 1 phone and 1 cover in the box and note said 2 packages so then began the arduous process of getting Samsung to understand our situation as we kept getting in various messages the the order had been delivered that there seem to be some suspicion that we were on it.  Finally they accepted that the other half of the order was missing and they would have to investigate it and then yesterday we got a message to say that the phone and cover would be returned to stock and we would get a refund. Fine i thought but no explanation of what had happened and the suspicion was off us.  Refund happened so I reordered a replacement which came this morning and on opening the box found it had a damaged screen so whole return process started again.  Very angry at the moment for such poor service.

                After getting no positive reply from several calls to Samsung and a formal complaint with them after they recommended Unique Repair Service in Indianapolis, In. as an authorized repair service for my dryer. The technician came and gave a diagnostic that it needed a new motor at a cost with labor of almost $500.00. They charged $109.00 for the diagnostic. Long story short-I called another repair service and the motor was fine, the dryer had nothing wrong with it. It was a blown fuse. I asked the Unique Repair Service for my money back for a completely false diagnostic and for trying to get me to pay a  high repair bill. They told me as soon as they make a house-call they charge whether they do anything or not. I then contacted Samsung because they have Unique as their authorized service repairs service and believe Samsung is responsible for them. After making a formal complaint and hours on the phone and a negative response from Samsung, they leave me no choice than to believe they don't care about their customers, therefore giving them a one star rating.

                Just adding to the catalogue of terrible reviews. I have an expensive washing machine and dryer and both been nothing but trouble. After 3 years the washing machine packed in. It says in huge letters 10 Year Warranty and in small letters 'on the motor'. Fortunately, the motor went but they still don't cover the labour which is frankly false advertising and wrong. Do not believe their warranties. Their products are poor and their after-sales is terrible and misleading at best.

                We have had our Samsung TV for just over 3 years and a thick black line appeared on the screen. Samsung told us there was nothing they could do to help. We paid a lot of money for the TV and expected it to last a lot longer than 3 years!!! Very disappointed with the TV and with Samsung Customer Service. We are now having to buy a new TV and it will not be a Samsung, Samsung Customer Services were not bothered at all.

                Purchased a 7 series white Samsung TV UE43RU7410UXXU. Made the fatal mistake of waiting for a builder / handyman to come over and mount the TV before opening it and he kept on postponing. Opened it for the first time on Friday 28th February and it was put up on the wall immediately and was working fine.  TV still has all the plastic on the frame and not a mark on it (also verified by Samsung via their app which allows them to view the TV through your phone). Thurs 5th March while listening to spotify the screen goes black. No picture, no sound after 6 days! This has to be a joke! Contacted Samsung and of course because it is out of the 28 day refund window (purchased from Argos) my only option is to get a repair.   If for arguments sake I had started using the TV as soon as I purchased it on the 28th of December, again why would I want a TV that has packed up within the first two months of use?! Very disappointing.   More annoyed at myself for waiting for the builder and not opening the TV straight away. but who expects a brand new TV to pack up after just six days???  Will be interesting to see how this repair turns out...

                Beware of Samsung Cashback promotions, they'll do anything to get out of paying. First they said that the documents I had uploaded had insufficient information. They were all John Lewis receipts and VAT receipts and contained all the information their terms and conditions specified. Finally a promotions representative validated the claim after numerous further document uploads which I asked John Lewis to provide (confirmed by email). Then a further rep phoned to say that the first rep had no authority to validate the claim and they were now declining the claim. And they've come up with a new reason - I'm out of time! I'm out of time because of Samsung. The original TV was faulty and returned after 20 days and a rep told me that the 30 day window to claim would begin 30 days after the replacement TV was ordered (there will be a recording of this). Now another rep is telling me that the claim should have been made within 30 days of the original purchase, so you're out of time mate! I am fighting this crowd with everything I have and will be taking advice. Even if I succeed I will never ever buy a Samsung product again and I will do my level best to make sure nobody else does.  NB: Subsequent to making the above post, Samsung have come back and acknowledged that they have made a mistake and have now validated my claim. However, I have not changed my view of this company. They have caused me so much stress and distress.

                S9 Plus phone had an issue with water detected on the charge port.  The phone had not been near water at all.   Contact Samsung, and the rep was really good, showed understanding, and arrange the phone to be fixed under warranty at a local Samsung store the very next day.   Took my phone to Samsung Store (best to make an appointment to guarantee time slot) and a Samsung Rep carried out a few tests and then booked the phone in to be fixed.  At this point i was expecting to be without a phone for a couple of days.  Surprised that she told me it could be fixed within a few hours, or at the latest the following day.  Received a text a few hours later to say the repair had been completed and my phone was ready to be picked up.   Wow. this is the level of service I expect in this day of age from a company of its statue. Very good.

                Really disappointed with the Galaxy phone I purchased last year. Never have I ever dropped a phone where the screen just smashes into a million tiny pieces the first time - surely they should not be allowed to sell phones that are not capable of withstanding normal wear and tear?! I've had this just under six months and it was immaculate until I dropped it!  And prior to the screen smashing, I have to say the touch screen was really slow and unresponsive most of the time. This phone is not worth the money and the camera on it isn't great either, I believe it's a galaxy j3? Will stick to Sony in future. Not impressed Samsung! Looked nice but not a practical purchase even for those of us who take good care of things!

                Samsung Microwave MC28M6075CS/EU Purchased directly from Samsung Online Store. Price similar to other retailers and includes 2 year warranty. Free shipping. Clear view so can see if you need to stop the microwave. Variety of functions. Hot blast is amazing and we used for baking cake and it baked very well. Also used for fries and cooked well. Light weight door operation. Turntable can be stopped. Microwave time can be manually set at 5 sec intervals so very precise. Good size for most cooking utensils. Delivery fast and well informed. I would recommend this product.

Time slots are really ridiculous. It is up to 10 30 am or up to 12 pm or after 12 pm. ???? Did ever Samsung hear about people who are going to work??? Most of working people leaving homes around 8am and coming home after 5-6 pm. There is not option for evening delivery. Well what you can excpect from DPD. I spoke with sale department and they say I could choose to pick up from their nearest pick up point. Well when I received tracking number I found out Samsung do not bother to pay DPD to add that options. So even you are willing to upgrade and pay, any option of collection from pick up point or leave it with neighborough or change delivery address is out ot plate. So I spend £159 for expensive earphones and Samsung has no decency to provide proper delivery service.

                My loyalty for Samsung and android is hanging by a mere thread. I have 2 Samsung Galaxy Note 9 devices. I paid over $1,000 each! To be forced to get the latest android 10 update was a terrible idea. At first the update hid all of my music, then i go to edit a video and now it crashes. I paid money to no longer be able to use my editor. Also this phone can barely even run Chrome before it crashes. I also used the S pen to edit pictures and  now the color grab is missing. What i mean by color grab is being able to choose a color from any picture and be able to write with that particular color. Now we are forced to only use the basic colors provided in the app. I don't know what is going on at Samsung  but it needs to be fix soon before i switch over to Microsoft or even Apple.

                After getting no positive reply from several calls to Samsung and a formal complaint with them after they recommended Unique Repair Service in Indianapolis, In. as an authorized repair service for my dryer. The technician came and gave a diagnostic that it needed a new motor at a cost with labor of almost $500.00. They charged $109.00 for the diagnostic. Long story short-I called another repair service and the motor was fine, the dryer had nothing wrong with it. It was a blown fuse. I asked the Unique Repair Service for my money back for a completely false diagnostic and for trying to get me to pay a  high repair bill. They told me as soon as they make a house-call they charge whether they do anything or not. I then contacted Samsung because they have Unique as their authorized service repairs service and believe Samsung is responsible for them. After making a formal complaint and hours on the phone and a negative response from Samsung, they leave me no choice than to believe they don't care about their customers, therefore giving them a one star rating.

                Appalling service network - was going to be 4 weeks to do a warranty repair and encouraged to buy a new machine instead for which they would discount 25% if bought via Samsung - discount couldn't be processed - blamed technical problems with voucher codes not being recognised and promised to honour discount retrospectively.  Now denying it all and refusing to honour the discount - entirely unethical and dishonest people.

                Just adding to the catalogue of terrible reviews. I have an expensive washing machine and dryer and both been nothing but trouble. After 3 years the washing machine packed in. It says in huge letters 10 Year Warranty and in small letters 'on the motor'. Fortunately, the motor went but they still don't cover the labour which is frankly false advertising and wrong. Do not believe their warranties. Their products are poor and their after-sales is terrible and misleading at best.

                We have had our Samsung TV for just over 3 years and a thick black line appeared on the screen. Samsung told us there was nothing they could do to help. We paid a lot of money for the TV and expected it to last a lot longer than 3 years!!! Very disappointed with the TV and with Samsung Customer Service. We are now having to buy a new TV and it will not be a Samsung, Samsung Customer Services were not bothered at all.

                Purchased a 7 series white Samsung TV UE43RU7410UXXU. Made the fatal mistake of waiting for a builder / handyman to come over and mount the TV before opening it and he kept on postponing. Opened it for the first time on Friday 28th February and it was put up on the wall immediately and was working fine.  TV still has all the plastic on the frame and not a mark on it (also verified by Samsung via their app which allows them to view the TV through your phone). Thurs 5th March while listening to spotify the screen goes black. No picture, no sound after 6 days! This has to be a joke! Contacted Samsung and of course because it is out of the 28 day refund window (purchased from Argos) my only option is to get a repair.   If for arguments sake I had started using the TV as soon as I purchased it on the 28th of December, again why would I want a TV that has packed up within the first two months of use?! Very disappointing.   More annoyed at myself for waiting for the builder and not opening the TV straight away. but who expects a brand new TV to pack up after just six days???  Will be interesting to see how this repair turns out...

Customer service based in Asia somewhere, the most painful conversation trying to actually get through to the point where an engineer would come out and look. Eventually managed to book in a slot - told them we could only do the following Monday, then received a confirmation email for Friday. Had to call again and change to Monday.  Monday comes, I have taken a day holiday and the engineer is apparently sick. Can't offer me any other times apart from Monday-Friday 9-5 (i work full time) and couldn't offer me any other solution, disappointing given the fact they are the ones cancelling. Not helpful when most people work full time. Will not be buying from Samsung again, very disappointed.

                Long story short. My phone ONE PLUS 7 PRO is in service at the moment. So I opened my bed side drawer and get out my old samsung grand prime phone. I do not want to waste my time to setup the phone so I just press a factory reset to clear all data. I planned to use this just a simple phone, i do not want to install anything. I put my sim card in the phone and it is asking me about a GOOGLE ACCOUNT. Which i do not want to use it. I do not need GOOGLE or facebook on this phone and I already have no idea which account was on the phone earlier. So after factory reset I realize I can not use the phone as a phone without login to GOOGLE ACCOUNT. I asked samsung support what to do now? This was the out come:  This is a Google security feature and cannot be cancelled unless you are able to remove the Google account before resetting.  So this means GOOGLE TAKE POWER OVER samsung. Without GOOGLE ACCOUNT OR CONTROL you are not able to use you own phone as a phone. I would like to know what law says about all of this. samsung factory installed a third party software on every device which can make your device completly unusable.  GOOGLE FACTORY PROTECTION LOCK. BIG GOOGLE TAKE CONTROLL OVER YOU and tiny samsung. WHAT A SHAME IS THIS FOR tiny samsung. What a joke is samsung?

                Tried 3 times to order a watch.  Called customer service.  They didn't help.  Samsung website is crap.  I can't update my account info and they won't do it at customer service.  They don't want my money I guess.  What's $200 to this company?  Who cares if you have bad service?  They don't obviously.

                Possibly the worst company for customer service. I bought my first ""smart"" TV from Samsung through John Lewis. Despite early niggles with the stand not fitting, it worked well for a few weeks. Then the trouble started. It has a record to HDD facility which was one of the attractions. Gradually, it deteriorated from being able to schedule recording, to not being able to record unless you were watching the programme. The bog standard support came up with stuff like factory resetting with all the grief that causes after you've set up i-player etc. Nothing worked and it just went on with their support churning out the same rubbish. Then I tried ""President Office Escalations"" - yes that was the name - hoping to get a result. Nothing. Three years later the only advice I got was delete all the recordings and try again. Delete all the recordings??? What the ****. That's what I bought it for, you foolish people (edited for Trust Pilot). A load of rubbish about their AV team working on it. More likely doing crosswords. A bit of research showed that this was a known problem, but either Samsung can't use Google search, or they don't like bad news. This Presidents Office stuff is a sham. It's the same crummy support people who couldn't care less and once any of their products are more than a month old, they move onto the next project like how to fold your phone in half or start a fire in your pocket. The trouble with Samsung is that they have too many sticky little fingers in too many pies and can't tell a washing machine from a TV. President Donald ""Duck"" Trump knows more about TVs than Mr President Sumsung. As soon as this TV is old enough to dump it, then that's what will happen. Samsung ain't no Rolls Royce and it shows. You might just as well buy the cheapest brand of Chinese TV and save a load of dosh. By buying Samsung, you are probably buying Chinese anyway, so just cut the middleman out. Even the Samsung computer monitor is rubbish. No VESA mount, fiddly controls and annoying pop-up menus. Needless to say, the other two are LG

                I bought a Samsung evo 860 Solid State hard drive and it didn't work correctly. I bought it at Best Buy and didn't get around to cloning it until about a month later. I bought the SSD from Best Buy but they  said because it was after two weeks I had to go through  Samsung. so after sending it in the mail, it came back to me in the exact same condition that it was in when I got it. I explain the particulars to Samsung but apparently there not the best technicians/customer care, because  I had time sensitiv matters pending I had to take my SSD to a computer Shop and have it fixed the right the first time. I sent samsung the bill But of course the didn""t offer to pay for my out of pocket expenses.   Negative 10 stars goes to Samsung custamer service and repair.

                Spent a load of money on a new Galaxy Fold phone at the end of January but because I am a few days out of the 30 day free insurance offer they won't honour it. I will never recommend Samsung again despite being a loyal customer for many years. I am disappointed that there is no loyalty at all and will never buy another Samsung product again. Customer service does not give a toss and can't be bothered.

The problems started we were away for several weeks and it would not let us register for the insurance it kept saying on both of our devices imei not recognised we could not contact Samsung because of the type of number we were calling . So on our first chance calling them we did unfortunately we were over the 30 days time limit you needed to register.  The very unhelpful girl on the end of the phone said tough luck I totally understand but we will not give your insurance to you . We have a samsung fridge cost £4500 7 samsung TVs  and over 20 samsung phones within our business.  Unless samsung read this and fix our free insurance I WILL NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN

                buying from samsung shop direct is the worst retail experience I have ever come across. customer service is a complete shambles and embarrassment, completely devoid of any common sense or communication ability.  Product took a week to arrive, arrived damaged, and was offered a replacement that could only be processed once the damaged unit was received back into their warehouse, meaning it would take another 12-16 days to receive a replacement. all in all, 3 weeks from order date to receive an £850 product is not acceptable. I was literally able to cancel the order, and go on to a local electrical website and order a different unit with a 2 day delivery slot, for £150 cheaper.  Complete waste of time and effort.

                Amazing service and free TV repair from Samsung for my seven year old Smart TV when its Smarthub stopped working, meaning that I could not access any apps or on-demand TV (e.g. iplayer, Netflix).  As I had already tried every option on my menu, including a full factory reset, and followed the instructions for my error message on both the Samsung website and various internet forums, I did not hold out much hope that it could be fixed.  One half hour phone call to Samsung later and the helpful Samsung lady in the Philippines had repaired my TV remotely free of charge.

                Poor quality chargers on mobiles and tablets. I have two mobiles and three tablets and the Samsung chargers have not lasted more than a couple of months on any of them. I have spent the cost of a new tablet trying to replace them all.  My other branded leads have lasted for years. Although I like the set up on samsung products, charging them is becoming a real problem so I will gradually replace them all.  Samsung please look at the quality of your accessories.

                I wouldn't even rate this company 1star. I have bought a washing machine from them less then 9months ago. The washing machine is making a sound like a plane ready to set off. The vibration is like it's going to explode. This has been happening since the start of December we are on the 22nd February 2020. Still not solved. They have sent out 7 engineers only one engineer changed the entire inside. Yet the problem.was not solved hence I have had so many engineers sent out after that. I don't see how they can not solve the problem. Now they want to send out the 8th engineer. 3months later I'm still having the problem. Never buy anything from them. The last 2 engineers have said no fault found. So I was asked to send a 2minute video of what I'm experiencing as of I'm lying. Rude! I have done this and yet they still want 8th engineer sent out. It costs them more to send all these engineers out. I just want my money back they can take the washing machine I do not want it. Ridiculous service so not professional you'd think it being such a huge international company they would beable to solve the problem instantly.  I have a elderly lady, a toddler and a new born due in a couple of weeks in need of a washing machine. This machine has packed on on me twice. I'm having to go laundrette no compensation. I'm having to take time off work for there engineers to attend which is ridiculous. I've had enough of this company the worst company ever!!!!! STAY AWAY FEOM THEM!!!!!!!!! IS ALL I CAN STRONGLY ADVISE!!!!!!

We called service, it took two visits to fix that problem but the repair caused a new problem, a horizontal pixel line across the screen. We’ve now had four repair visits and each time the repairman cannot fix it.  Each time we call, they say they want to try To fix it again.    At the last visit they said they would replace the TV, but now they want to come out ONE MORE TIME.   We will not give up, nor would we ever purchase or recommend anything made by Samsung.

Took me over 10 calls to the support center, pick up day was allocated, so waited whole day at home on that day and no one turned up, no notification of the pick up happening was sent (despite being promised), took me ages to rearrange, once rearranged no notification of the pick up was ever sent to me. Finally the collection people turned up and just walked in took the tele and drove off, did not answer anything about if they work for Samsung or if they have any paperwork. Support centre is like in the stone age, people sometimes barely speak english, generally do not quite understand questions and ask crazy number of security questions everytime

Full coverage will take The product must be like in the unbox condition only the product will replace to the costumer. So this brand is not a costumer supportive on and The damaged product with are collected from the service center They repair and sell it on market ... SO  don't use the Brand

                Probably the worst customer experience… Probably the worst customer experience I have ever had from the Samsung promoted and approved mobile phone repair service from WeFix The Samsung website offered an approved phone repair service, which I thought was Samsung provided. It turned out to be provided by WeFix, but as it was Samsung approved, I expected a smart approach with great customer service. However, this wasn’t how it turned out. I have had some shocking customer experiences in my time, but this one takes the biscuit. My warning to potential customers is that you need to ensure you fit without the specific way this service works, otherwise you will be out of pocket. I am £59 out of pocket and still have a broken phone as I refused to accept the additional charges. WeFix processed a refund, however they refused to refund the full booking fee. I will be taking this complaint further through other channels on principle. I believe others will have been hit by these hidden and disproportioned charges, that were caused by their own poor systems and processes. The problem with their experience occurs when you place a booking for a repair. You can only pick a day and there is no flexibility to select a time slot or even a morning or afternoon slot. They inform you that they will contact you on the day to tell you what time the engineer will arrive. Most companies that don't have the systems to offer time slots then give you flexibility to change the slot or call you in the morning to make sure the slot is suitable. You only get informed at 8am on the day of the repair, so If the slot is not suitable then it doesn’t give you a lot of time to plan. As I booked the repair on the 6/2/2020 for the repair to take place on the 11/2/2020 they had plenty of time in advance to inform me of the time slot. As soon as I received the slot I rang them when their call centre opened at 9am to ask for a different slot. I was told that I could only move the slot if I pay £59 on top of the repair cost. The slot they gave me fell right at the time of the school pickup and I had no time to rearrange. Their website made clear in the terms and conditions (only visible after the booking was made) that I would be charged for changing the booking time. However, it didn’t make clear that I would not be able to pick a suitable timeslot in the first place. They did not make it clear that they will automatically select a timeslot. I believe WeFix imposes hidden charges on customers and makes disproportioned and unreasonable charges for making changes to bookings. To further exacerbate my frustration with this poor customer experience I sent WeFix two complaints through their website and one via Twitter. I have not received a response from them apart from sending me an invite to provide a review on TrustPilot. So being the good customer that I am I have kindly provided some feedback. I hope this feedback can help potential customers navigate the pitfalls of the way their systems and processes work. I also hope that it helps WeFix to improve how they work and consider a more customer centric approach to the way they work. I think its great that a UK company is offering this kind of service and that they have managed to land a contract with Samsung to be their approved supplier. The trouble is, they are unlikely to keep hold of this contract if they don’t improve how they work. I have read the other reviews on TrustPilot and many are very positive, particularly with the engineers, so it’s a shame that they are let down by other parts of the service.

The 1st courier service they assigned to pick my phone up never turned up so they changed to a different service provider namely dpd after about 3 days!  Be very careful when you send your phone off for repair and film the dpd driver as he opens the box to take a photo of the phone, as he dropped mine and deneyed it. I then get a call from Samsung saying the wanted £230 from me to fix the screen before they could fix my faulty charge port, the phone didn't have a scratch on it when i handed it over. Between samsung and dpd they failed to agree liability and i had to claim off my insurance and pay an excess. No help at all from Samsung after the courier service they use broke my phone and left me without a phone for 3 weeks!

They sent an engineer who advised that the machine should be replaced which they refused and stated that it should be repaired and I am still waiting for someone to contact me on 17.02.2020 (February). I have rung them and they have the most UNPROFESSIONAL agency you can deal with. I have had the phone hung up on me, I have been placed on hold and no one returns, I have a case reference number which I give them but is useless because I have to explain everything from the beginning every time. This washer dryer has had faults from the time of purchase but they told me that I should reset it with them over the phone, which I did and they said the problems should resolve themselves over time (twice). When I challenged this later they said “oh 4 weeks has now lapsed so you cannot return it to the store you bought it from and will have to let us try and resolve the matter. Almost a year on they are still trying to resolve it and they rub it in that the policy states that they can do so up to 5 times” but they are stretching these 5 times out for their benefit in my view. They send someone who just comes and ‘tinkers’ then they disappear and I can’t get anything done in between. Meanwhile I am just waiting for my house to burn down if I use it as advised or go to the launderette for safety when I have a machine at home.

                Absolutely shocking customer service i have to say. The 1st courier service they assigned to pick my phone up never turned up so they changed to a different service provider namely dpd after about 3 days!  Be very careful when you send your phone off for repair and film the dpd driver as he opens the box to take a photo of the phone, as he dropped mine and deneyed it. I then get a call from Samsung saying the wanted Â£230 from me to fix the screen before they could fix my faulty charge port, the phone didn't have a scratch on it when i handed it over. Between samsung and dpd they failed to agree liability and i had to claim off my insurance and pay an excess. No help at all from Samsung after the courier service they use broke my phone and left me without a phone for 3 weeks! I have had near every galaxy s model that they have released but Never again will i buy a samsung product!

                I would rate Samsungs repair of our electric range/ oven at less than 1 if that was a choice. This is the worst service we have experience in our 50 years of marriage. If you expect service of appliances you purchase go any place other than Samsung.

                I am normally a great fan of John Lewis &amp; Partners, but recent events have made me re-think that!  There appears to be a large number of Samsung customers experiencing the same issue with their TVs as myself. That being, large purple patches developing on the screen which cannot be repaired, in some cases as soon as 2 years after purchasing. The only solution being to have the screen replaced at an unviable cost. Samsung are making no acknowledgement of the level of complaints about this issue, which, with the volume of posts on numerous noticeboards, can only be the result of a manufacturing or design issue.  I also have this ‘Purple Patch’ issue with my 5 year old Samsung UE50H6400, purchased from John Lewis. So I am outside of their 5 year warranty, but still within the 6 year claim period of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. I called John Lewis to discuss my intention to pursue a claim on this basis and they came back to me with the suggestion that if I paid the £105.00 call out charge for a Samsung engineer to confirm that my TV was “either inherently faulty or unrepairable”, then John Lewis would be able to settle my claim to the sum of £22.20. CHECKMATE!

                Liars and scammers  Hi Trading standings, This complain is about Samsung rolling out corrupt update to a phone software which wouldn't allow customers to connect to a third party electrical equipment. In my case, I am connecting my samsung mobile phone to my panasonic tv. I have chased them for 3 weeks and all they have caused more and more problems. First they blocked my email address purposely then I started chasing them for solution from another address and Finally I submitted an email to CEO upon which I had some response. Samsung reprensetantive Sean booked a repair. The repair technician who came to my home was able to connect his Samsung phone to my Panasonic tv but because of there corrupt update I can't connect mine which he himself accept that it's a phone software malfunctions. I performed all the steps which they asked me to do including factory reset which I wasn't willing to do originally but there repair technician corrupted the phone further due to which we cant use the phone any more because it went on boot loop/restarting . Samsung is purposely crashing customer connection with other 3rd party devices so that they have to buy there TVs. I want Samsung to compensate for all the stress they have cause and sort the features which they purposely corrupted on latest android 10 update. ALL THE PICTURES WITH MY NEW BORN FOR LAST 15 MONTHS ARE GONE. ALL my bank account login IDs they are gone   It's not the case that Samsung hasn't done this malpractice previously. THey have also been previously accused of similar malpractices where they were penalised.  Hopefully, some in UK regulatory body will going to take action against them. I am happy to file a case against them in the small county court if required. Regards Muhammad

                Battery on my Samsung Watch failed. I was told I had to book an appointment so that someone could tell me it had failed. Only then could I book it in for repair. I was slightly late for my appointment, so they cancelled it. Told me I had to book another appointment. I just walked out. Customer Service means providing a service to your customers, not expecting your customers to arrange their whole week around your representatives. You are not that important. Not a problem anymore. No longer a Samsung customer.

                Bought their TV about two years ago. The TV screen has been flickering and acting up since last year but not often. As it still within the warranty, I sent a video clip to show the customer service what the issue is. Returned my TV at the repair centre for further assessment and repair.  Apparently they didn't find any issue. They claim it as no fault but cannot explain why the TV screen was flickering. Nothing was fixed, no repair was carried out. Receiving my FAULTY TV back. Completely waste of time. Ask the customer service what to do if this happened again or outside warranty. Their reply was to contact them again and see what they can do.  DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A FAULT THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM NOR FIX IT!  GOOD LUCK

I called samsung and they offered a return and said they’d booked the delivery in. I rang up and they said the delivery was never booked in so it couldn’t be collected, so i booked it in again and received a text notification and they arranged it for the WRONG day so i had to rearrange again! In all it took about 2 weeks for my tv to be collected. I ordered a newer model off the tv as i thought it would be better quality (£900 tv may i add) this broke within 5 weeks too! Half the screen went dark. I have rang samsung and they were meant to collect day but rang yesterday and it has not been booked in again!!!

Staff in store gave me 5 excuses as to why they couldn't help with my faulty product, none of which made any sense, treating me like I'm an fool. All this AFTER I had been referred to the store by the online team.   Called customer services, again got the run around for 20 minutes. The team on the phone doing all they could to push my manufacturer warranty claim to the retailer (or anyone they could think of). Refused my legal right to pursue a claim under warranty for a manufacturer defect in a 3 month old product, telling me I should claim from the company that sold me it. Clearly no training in what the law says or in customer service.

                My name is Lam. I'm Samsung loyal customer for more than 10 years. Recently,I bought the Samsung Note 10+ on Cyber Monday with the deal $500 store credit, so I decided to use the credit to get the tablet s6 on Dec 2, 2019 and the order # S1C4VC60SR. I kept the tablet for 2 months still sealed never open it. So today Feb 5, 2020; I was so exciting to open the tablet to use it for the first time. When I turn the tablet on the the screen is not working, I thought that the battery is low, so I use the original charger that came with device to charge, but the device wont turn on. I contacted the customer service on Samsung.com and the representative told me to bring the tablet to Samsung store and they will give me the replacement no question ask. I drove about 2 hours to the store, when I got there, I showed them the text between me and customers service, but they won't accept to give replacement for me,  as what the representative on Samsung.com have said.The Samsung store's employee called the customers service on Samsung.com, after that they told me they can't give me the replacement, only option they can offer me that to claim the warranty and fix my tablet. I asked them my tablet is brand new, I want to get a replacement for another brands new device, and I do not feel comfortable with the repair like that. They told me that, it is the only way to do. My question is that way you do it will make the customers happy with your company? Second questions is how different when you buy the product from the Samsung store and Samsung.com, when the customers need help your help, and you say that you cannot do anything when your buy online Samsung.com. What is wrong? It is does not matter Samsung store or Samsung.com are still belong Samsung company. I feel like you are cheating on your customers like me in this case that do not allow have any choice or personal opinion. Your product not cheap, the cost is almost like Apple's products. Do you know why Apple have more customers than Samsung? Because they are think for their customers, and they are do not cheating on customers like your company. They have the best service in the market. Samsung just want your money, and you do not care for the customers at all. I hope the Samsung owner can read everything I write and my opinion of the way your business and your employees how they are cheating on customers. I hope all customers can read this message, and speak up for themselves to get Samsung's become more friendly to the loyal customers.  Samsung do not let your customers thinking your company is chasing the revenue and only cheating them. Hopefully I get the response from the Samsung owner to explain to me about this matter.  Best regard.

                Welcome to my Samsung USA HORROR story. Sorry , this will be longish and every word is the truth. I live in Toronto, Canada. On a vacation trip Dec/19 to Scottsdale AZ I left my Samsung tablet on the West Jet plane by mistake. Never to be seen again. On Dec 26/19 I went to Best Buy in Scottsdale and bought a new Samsung S3 tablet and the matching Samsung case with keyboard. All until Nov/19 when I decided to expand my memory storage with a micro SD card. Bought two, one for my Samsung S9+ cell and the tablet. New card worked perfect on cell but didn’t work on the tablet.  I went to a Samsung Experience store in Toronto. The tech there diagnosed the problem to be a faulty motherboard, which he said was probably from day 1. The tablet is still under warranty (I have all of the original paperwork, store invoice etc.) BUT the Samsung rep proceeds to tell me that Samsung Canada and Samsung US are two different operations and they would/could not repair my tablet as I had to send it to the US for repair. I was also told by a Best Buy store in Toronto that their US and Canadian operation are independent for warranty purposes.  I contacted Samsung US (Nov/19) who confirms the NON International warranty situation and proceeds to tell me the following. Samsung US will email me a UPS shipping label for the return BUT the unit mailed be shipped from within the US AND Samsung will not return my unit to Canada.  Also, the UPS shipping label is only good for 7 days.  GREAT !!!   OK, I believe a have a game plan.  We were going into Buffalo NY for New Years then going to Florida from Jan 7 – 31 / 20.  He advised to call back around Dec 29/19 to get a UPS shipping label.  Following his suggestion, I called back Dec 26/19 to get the UPS label, the Samsung person asked me why I was waiting to send the tablet as the UPS shipping label CAN be used from Canada.  This is where the nightmare begins. Following his (Samsung’s) instructions I package up my tablet with the accessories as the instructions say to do.  Also, as per the written instructions I unlock to tablet so it can be repaired.  Shipped it off to Samsung repair in New Jersey, with my Florida return address. I rushed to UPS to ship my tablet and that was the last time I would see it…….   By the way, I am a CPA who now has an unlocked Samsung tablet floating around.   Apparently, the last Samsung rep was totally wrong, the UPS shipping label CAN NOT be shipped from Canada. Zoom ahead a few months and probably 20 – 25 hours on the phone with calls to UPS and Samsung, I have emails from UPS saying how Samsung US was not co-operating with them, holding everything up. UPS finally throws in towel and declares my shipment lost and sends me a lost package claim form. I send it off with all pertinent info needed.  UPS gets back to saying they can only pay this loss claim to the shipper who they declare is Samsung US and not me. I now reach out to Samsung Case Mgmt. rep (probably the 5th person in this top echelon)  (Manager -   Albert  - ID  0864  - Case Mgmt. ticket # 4151977296) seeking payment. This is Samsung’s US ultimate resolution.  They will pay me for the lost/defective tablet but not for the lost case/keyboard as it is their policy not to pay for accessories. I told them that I have a HUGE problem with that as UPS is willing and prepared to pay Samsung for the entire lost shipment. I could not get the Samsung manager to understand the concept that ultimately they were not paying me but UPS is, if Samsung makes the appropriate loss claim to UPS, I could not get through to him.    WAIT, we are not done yet.    Apparently, the Samsung US computer software is NOT capable of entering a Canadian address in their system to mail me my cheque directly so I have to have it send to a friend in Florida who in turn with will mail it to me. What an unbelievable nightmare and horror story. I don’t think I could have created a bizarre, crazy story like this if I had tried !! Not one person I have spoken

This is Samsungâ€™s US ultimate resolution.  They will pay me for the lost/defective tablet but not for the lost case/keyboard as it is their policy not to pay for accessories. I told them that I have a HUGE problem with that as UPS is willing and prepared to pay Samsung for the entire lost shipment. I could not get the Samsung manager to understand the concept that ultimately they were not paying me but UPS is, if Samsung makes the appropriate loss claim to UPS, I could not get through to him.    WAIT, we are not done yet.    Apparently, the Samsung US computer software is NOT capable of entering a Canadian address in their system to mail me my cheque directly so I have to have it send to a friend in Florida who in turn with will mail it to me. What an unbelievable nightmare and horror story. I donâ€™t think I could have created a bizarre, crazy story like this if I had tried !! Not one person I have spoken

                Customer service is a joke, have been waiting for a new replacement oven. Each time you call them you spend holding for at least 45 minutes and trust me it is not resolve on one or two calls. Been told by the engineer the oven is manufacture faulty. After three calls today got told it will take 10 to 14 working days for a logistic company to contact me for a delivery and  No installation is provided.  NO MORE SAMSUNG IN MY HOUSE

                Samsung promotion offering 50% cashback on high-end soundbar if purchased within 30 days of high-end TV. I Spent around £3800 on purchase expecting about £750 back for the soundbar. When they eventually replied to my emails, I was told that I had only applied for the promotion on the TV, not the soundbar even though I followed their instructions extremely carefully!!! I scanned both my TV receipt and soundbar receipt and sent in one e-mail as that's what the brochure said - apparently, I was supposed to send in two separate applications even though it was very clear that I wanted the money back for the soundbar - instead, they sent me 10 Rakuten movie rental vouchers for the TV purchase. Absolute SCAM - I'll never buy Samsung again.

                Customer service is a joke.Lost all respect to the Samsung brand. 4 months ago claimed my Samsung ear buds with note 10+ purchase. And all I have done is endless emails and calls empty promises and radio silence  afterwards .They practice false advertisement and false promotions they put all efforts to avoid for filling .  Biggest regret and life lesson was 1000 euro spent on the phone where company does not care about customer rights.

                Worst shopping experience I’ve ever had. Bought a Q80r TV. Confirmed faulty within 30 days. Advised I could repair or replace but best to replace as it was within 30 days. Communication was terrible. They were supposed to send a returns box but didn’t. Informed they had to return to site and then I would have to wait 10 working days for replacement as they can’t do both in the same day!  I would suggest they just don’t trust their customers.....even though I’d sent images and the fault had been confirmed.  Day after the return I get an email with a confirmation of a refund, no explanation. After calling again for the 5th time, informed they had no stock so had refunded me without letting me know. If I’d had the option I would have just taken the repair. No alternative offered.  Shocking customer service. I won’t buy Samsung again.

                You buy a smartphone from a trusted brand safe in the knowledge there is a 24 month guarantee and you assume excellent customer service.   Just shows how wrong you can be.   Display on Note 8 started flashing but only in 50% of the screen, the rest of the screen was black. No worries contact customer service and get a free warranty repair.   I sent the phone of to a service centre in Poland (from Germany) and wait. A few days later I get asked for EUR 180 to repair it. They apparently found a microscopic blemish on the side of the screen somewhere. They sent a photo with a 40x magnification picture of it. When you go to such lengths to blame customers and avoid your guarantee this makes me very suspicious. It seems odd that the screen was exactly occulting at 50%, was I so precise in creating my microscopic damage?  So trust lost from a previously loyal customer.

                Samsung stick rigidly to the 28 days return &amp; replace policy even if the merchandise was faulty the day it left the factory.  The brand is letting itself down. Brand new Note 10 plus 5G just had PBA Module replaced after fault detected 34 days after receipt of goods. Painful parts are a) it was almost impossible to detect the problem in the timeframe; b) Samsung service centre staff Plymouth were not particularly helpful and seemed unskilled in diagnosing fault/explaining issues. Outcome stuck with a phone I've lost confidence in. Also brand loyalty gone too.

After 15 mins on the phone asking my name , my phone number, my email , address (don't understand for what purpose), they told me to unplug the tv, first for 1 min and then for 10 min, still wouldn't connect.

                The support for smartphones in the UK appears to be incredibly poor.  Inaccessible technical centres and engineers (no working phone or voicemail, engineer absent or busy with backlogs and unable to see a customer or product for days, while they advertise that they fix phones normally within one hour).  A very fragmented answering system with automatic messages or different people who appear to answer beside the point of your problem or question.  A website that is very badly conceived and appears more to drive customers away from support.  Also, wrong or incomplete website information.  Support people who do seem to know what is going on in the company (where to find information, or where to forward your requests), as if they were all from several different companies and had never experienced the service they are providing.  A system that appears to be in place to minimise the inconvenience of customer support questions, and to maximise the cost of repairs or support, instead of trying to maximise customer satisfaction and provide an excellent service at a fair price.  Individually, people who work there might appear to do their best but the system needs a very serious overhaul, with an assessment of actual efficiency and effect on customer...  I have been caught twice, having gone back with a Samsung product, after a first bad experience.  The second experience is so traumatic (long, exhausting, etc. for zero result) that I do not think I would have the courage to try and buy any more of their products.

                Samsung is probably the worst company that I have had the misfortune to deal with regarding Reliability and Warranty support.  My story: I bought my first Samsung Combi Microwave in April 2017 which broke down and was sent back to Amazon.es under their own 2 year warranty and they refunded me.  Then I bought my 2nd Combi microwave on March 7 2018 from Amazon.es but this time through a third party seller.  Again I have had nothing but problems with it since then.  In early April 2019, the button board electronics failed and It was taken away and repaired by an engineer from Algeciras, Spain.   The buttons failed for the second time in November 2019. It was repaired again and the engineer said that if I had any more problems, they would replace the microwave   The same day I received the microwave back after the second repair it started sparking and I sent a video to the engineer. He agreed that Samsung should now replace the microwave.    However, various discussions with Samsung produced no positive result and then over and after the Christmas period of 2019 all communication ceased.  When I eventually spoke to Samsung's warranty department in January 2020, they had the nerve to say that the sparking was not covered by the warranty and was my problem.   It began to spark the same day that the engineer returned it to me, but they did not take this fact into account. I would suggest that some engineer caused the problem during the repair. How could it have been me?  I only started it with just a cup of milk inside, so that suggestion was ridiculous. I bought the microwave through Amazon.es, but because it was sold by a third party seller 'Electroshop Online' they couldn't offer much help.  The seller didn't want to know and just said Contact Samsung and after several more attempts to solve the problem I gave up.  My advice ….do not buy a Samsung microwave !

                Samsung is probably the worst company that I have had the misfortune to deal with regarding Reliability and Warranty support.  My story: I bought my first Samsung Combi Microwave in April 2017 which broke down and was sent back to Amazon.es under their own 2 year warranty and they refunded me.  Then I bought my 2nd Combi microwave on March 7 2018 from Amazon.es but this time through a third party seller.  Again I have had nothing but problems with it since then.  In early April 2019, the button board electronics failed and It was taken away and repaired by an engineer from Algeciras, Spain.   The buttons failed for the second time in November 2019. It was repaired again and the engineer said that if I had any more problems, they would replace the microwave   The same day I received the microwave back after the second repair it started sparking and I sent a video to the engineer. He agreed that Samsung should now replace the microwave.    However, various discussions with Samsung produced no positive result and then over and after the Christmas period of 2019 all communication ceased.  When I eventually spoke to Samsung's warranty department in January 2020, they had the nerve to say that the sparking was not covered by the warranty and was my problem.

                Samsung will not honour warranties if you purchase on the ebay platform  I'm sure this is illegal in the UK manufacturers are required to provide items that are fit for purpose. It is against UK statutory rights - we would thought need to take them to the small claims court .

Said that the delivery would be today s took off work to receive it waited all day no delivery called the 800 #. Was put on hold for several minutes to be told it may be tomorrow or next day and that someone would call. So i then call Samsung to complain all i received was someone who could not speak English  very well, then all she would say so sorry so sorry a lot help that is. Better off just going to best buy or some other store. For a company the size of Samsung they need to do better very disappointed.

                Samsung does not provide customer service, only heaps of frustration. We've been trying to get Samsung to repair our 65"" television for 2 years now. After buying better HDMI cables, numerous calls and chat sessions, as well as filing a BBB report they finally sent out Dish technicians to repair the television with new parts. Two weeks ago, the techs spent over 3 hours replacing the main board, cables and a couple other parts. They could not get the TV to work properly, so they took it apart again to put all the old parts back. They had me sign a contract that I couldn't make out, due to the signature area covering the contract on the iPad. The tech said he would email me a copy of what they did on the contract. I did receive the contract, but other than my signature, it's completely blank? Yes, I unwittingly signed a blank contract? Samsung even told the BBB that the case is resolved, because their techs were fixing it? They did not. I hadn't heard anything from Samsung, so I emailed Montez Gaffney @ Samsung Office of President who had the service techs sent to our home. He refuses to respond to me or the BBB now, so I'm forced to write reviews and get consumer affairs involved. Our 2 Panasonic plasma televisions haven't given us a lick of trouble in 7-8 years, but all we've had with this Samsung is 2 years of headaches.

                I bought a Samsung A50 in Peru Lima Airport from a phone shop in December 2019. I was assured of a worldwide guarantee and it's fine in UK. Got home phone never worked, visited Glasgow shop twice, took 2 half days off work to go up and personal cost. I am self employed. Shop says can't do anything put it down to a bad experience, contacted customer services they said they would collect the phone, it went to Glasgow. An attempt was made to change motherboard etc but no solution was found. The phone was returned screen all scratched. I called Glasgow shop they said we never touched your phone, yet 2 days earlier a colleague informed me it was stripped down. I have called and been hung up on after long holds. I have been treated with disrespect, bad experience, asked do you want the phone back etc. I requested a contact to help me, they don't know anything, I requested email or phone number for CEO Mr Chun, they never knew who he was, best of all no contact information. This for a global company is a joke, shop service experience, waited in a que 45 minutes to get seen to, told to come back in 45 minutes, waited another 30 minutes to get nothing, no decision no responsibility. Calls made, put on hold for hours, hung up on during holds, never got call backs ignored. No structure to get information or assistance to help you get a resolve. I am almost £300 out of pocket, SAMSUNG is £300 up and I get not only a broken device but one badly scratched screen to. I have tried every angle and will continue to spread the word of total incompetence untill I get answers. If Samsung are happy with this treatment then I can't recommend them, we have Tv's, watches, phones etc but will I buy another product. Not sure if I could stomach all this disgraceful treatment again. I gave Samsung a 1 star in this review only because if I never there was no review.

If you have worked hard for your money stay away from this brand.  There are plenty of brands out there at much less cost, which will get you to the warranty period.

It has been stated they will replace the machine under guarantee but many weeks on we are still being ignored and are none the wiser what is going on.

This machine only likes full loads to wash, anything under 70% full and it wont spin it, so the washing comes out dripping, you have to run a separate spin cycle at least 1s or wash again in a bigger load. Unless you are drying a pair of socks you have to put the machine on the drying cycle at least twice to get a half load dry. Compared to my last 2 washer dryers by other brands it takes at least double the amount of time to get a load washed and dried in this machine. I generally buy a new machine every 3-4 years, I give up with this machine and i'm off to buy a new 1. I'm a working mum and dont have time to sit by the machines side!!

                If I could give a minus review I would!. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT. I have spent £1500 in the last month brought 2 phones. They adverts and promotions are a gimmick.  On the 25.12.19 they had 2 offers on with a phone. I have never come across Customer service like Samsung. It's like talking to children infact worse at least children listen. The company should be called SAM SANK. They don't care about you all they want is your money once they have that god help you. They are incapable of dealing with anything let alone a query. I would love the CEO to email me with regarding to my complaint. I am angry with myself for actually think that this company cares about its customers clearly it doesn't. I'm moving to APPLE at least the after care is excellent. I should have listened to my son who works on the customer service desk of a very well know electrical shop. He said that the worse item to purchase is a ""SAMSUNG"" item as the customer service is non EXISTENT! He said to me don't even bother ringing them you will be wasting your time. Boy was he right.

                Do not buy the note 10 plus. It has a temprature sensor that doesn't work and your phone will never charge, and Samsung can't even admit this issue like they did with the Note 7. I deeply regret this 1000 euro and I will never spend a penny on a Samsung product again. When I spend 1000 euros on a phone I should at least expect it to charge. The folks down at Samsung service can't understand to remove the temprature limits so I guess I am stuck with a 1000 euro useless landline phone, ty Samsung.

                I mistakenly locked my new cell phone and could not get it to unlock. I got in touch with a young man named Timothy in the Philippines and he was the most pleasant, helpful person I have dealt with in quite some time. He was very patient and helped walk me through everything I needed to do to get my phone back up and running. He asked if I would like to take a short survey and I agreed but the phone call ended.  I wanted to give him an excellent rating for sure, just sorry I did not get to do it.  I hope someone in management sees this and can let him know that I did appreciate his help.

                Worst comstomer service EVER!!! I bought a washing machine and it's total garbage right out of the box. I paid for it to be delivered, and installed to have it never work. I call the phone number to only be disconnected, waiting, and transfered from person to person. Then after all that I get someone that says they will send a technician to my house to fix the problem. I told them it's brand new and I didn't pay for a repaired washing machine. Also I went online and looked at the reviews for this mechine and they are HORRIBLE! Now I see the reviews for the comstomer service and they are also HORRIBLE. I can't believe Samsung is this poor with products and services. I would never buy a Samsung product EVER. Home appliances, electronics, and even cell phone. They are falling behind and soon they will be nothing anymore. Listen to the reviews when they say they are trash products and service.

                I wanted to connect my (apartment's) TV to the web. After a software update it worked, however slow. To communicate with the TV I would need a mouse and keyboard. As it didn't seem to support bluetooth I called Samsung support who confirmed it wouldn't. They had no idea what type of mouse/keyboard I could use. The accessories team did not know either. In an email they recommended then a bluetooth keyboard (no mouse). Explaining that their own customer service confirmed it doesn't have bluetooth didn't impress them. My next electronic device (phone, TV etc.) will not be Samsung. There is no technical support and you might end up buying unsuitable equipment.

                Samsung DO NOT have a customer service department. Instead you are transferred to a call center in New Delhi where the staff are robotic and have zero empathy to your complaints. After buying a brand new Samsung TV this year we found that it couldn't connect with our game consoles. The hdmi port also sparked when we tried to change the leads. After about 5 called to the 'support' line we were told that it wasn't the TVs fault and to call the company of the consoles. I decided to speak to a manager, was put on hold then was cut off. I had to call another department in order for them to transfer me. The manager was worse than the technical 'support' team. He was almost silent and was very clipped with his replies. After 10 minutes he finally decided to send out an engineer. After 2 days I got a  text to say a person would be coming.... 1 week later!!!! Annoyed I phoned a number for somewhere in England. The woman was worse than the technical team. Very aloof. Uncaring, She even stated in an aggressive tone, 'other people are on the same boat as you'. I replied, ""If You know this why is Samsung ignoring their customer care?""  She was silent and dismisive. So now I have an engineer arriving on a day that I am at work. If he decides not to slot us in on a time when I am home we will have to wait another week with this awful TV.  After years of trusting Samsung, I will not but parting with my money on their products again.

                Don't pay for a specific time slot for delivery!  I ordered a new phone (Galaxy S10+) yesterday morning and paid for 'select a time slot' delivery - next day before 10:30am. It's now 10:20, payment still hasn't been taken, and the website still says 'preparing for dispatch'.  I contacted live chat and chatted to a customer service agent online and then another on the phone. The agents were very nice, but couldn't explain why there had been a delay, only that they were preparing to pass my package to DPD who will then contact me with a delivery time. I'm therefore none the wiser about when to expect it to arrive. They did say I would get a refund on the delivery cost, but I'm not going to hold my breath...

                I purchased a phone, and the next day I tried to cancel the order. Not only was the option not available to me, it was also not available to any customer service agents either. Samsung as the seller had placed restrictions on my delivery as well, and made it so I could not refuse the package I had paid my money for. I then had to bounce back and forth between Samsung and the shipping company on cancelling it. After 5 separate calls and about 2 and a half hours of call time I was able to refuse the package. Just kidding, it still arrived at my house, and now I have to wait for it to go all the way back to Samsung, who was aware of me not wanting the package before it was even shipped. While the customer service agents we're good at damage control, no one was actually able to do anything. I will no longer be conducting business with them

I ordered a washing machine from Samsung on 20/12/19 as my current washing machine had broken down and I am having a full house over Christmas. The reason I ordered from Samsung was because they offered next day delivery for £30.   I received an email giving me a 2 hour window for delivery. During the delivery window I received a text from the delivery company informing me they hadn’t received the washing machine from Samsung.   I phoned Samsung and was told they will inform their logistics department and they will get in touch with me.   It is now Christmas Eve, my guests are about to turn up and I have no way for people to wash their clothes. I phoned Samsung again and was told the logistics team will be in touch and I just need to keep waiting.   Samsung’s customer service is a shambles.

                Very disappointed with the Samsung TV we purchased for our parents on 12/12/17 as a Christmas gift.  (Samsung 40MU6120 ) In July 2018 a mere 7 months later the tv experienced serious screen distortion. A number of white lines appeared in the centre of the screen. We contacted Samsung who put us in touch with a company who would rectify the fault. I was somewhat surprised that instead of replacing the tv they merely replaced the screen. In November of  this year the same fault occurred with a number of white vertical lines appearing on the screen. Enquiries at Curry’s where tv was purchased could not assist as the tv was out of guarantee. The sales assistant informed us that it would be a pressure fault, we were unlucky but it is quite common in Samsung. To say I was disappointed to have a tv last under 2 years including in that time a replacement screen is an understatement but the response from Samsung was even more disappointing. The company who replaced the screen after 7 months quoted £350 for a new screen but offered to approach Samsung to see if they would give us a goodwill gesture and allow replacement of screen for cost. (Ie about £150). This was refused so my parents are now having replace their TV. They will not be purchasing Samsung but will return to Sony. This experience from such a large company has caused great disappointment and will certainly discourage me from purchasing Samsung again. I would expect a TV to last longer than 2 years.

                I have just bought two QLED Samsung TV Bundles (Q70R 49inch, Q60R 43inch and two soundbars) through Samsung Online (I previously had a 47inch Toshiba). The products are fantastic and they are well worth the price. The Samsung AI upscaling is incredible and definitely outperforms other TV brands. I recently watched BBC David Attenborough’s Seven Worlds, One Continent in stunning 4K HDR and I have never seen anything like it. The TVs are well made and are easy to set up. The Smart facility of the TV has a fantastic range of streaming apps and is very responsive and easy to navigate. The soundbars are also incredible but the TV alone has great speakers. I would highly recommend both TVs. Delivery was also prompt (delivered by Panther Group). I will be buying from you again in the near future.  I also used the Samsung Live Chat service to ask for assistance and Ellie G was extremely helpful and very pleasant.

                Terrible Customer Service  I've never in my life felt more compelled to write a review regarding customer service, of which Samsung have none - they should be ashamed.  Should you call the ""0330 SAM SHOP"", you will be presented an enthusiastic operator who promises you they will sort your issue, only for them not to call or email you back with an update, or for the wrong information to be passed over further wasting your time and no remorse for in the inconvenience.  I ordered a TV in November, the item was not delivered so asked for a redelivery on a specified date. The date I requested was not passed on to the logistics company but booked for whatever slot was going which meant no one was home to receive it and the delivery was missed again.  Called customer service multiple times after that where (I thought) we had arranged a new time for delivery, only for the slot not to be booked with the logistics company at all.  You can imagine the frustration this has caused and hassle where schedules had to be reworked and amounted to nothing. The TV was bought in the Black Friday Sales and has enviably gone back up to a price point I'm not willing to pay for. So not only have I endured this, I won't be able to purchase the TV I wanted!  My last encounter, a request (again) for a new delivery date, resulted in the operator promising to call me back when they reached the bottom of my issue, only to receive an email saying my order was complete, an invoice and my supposed request for refund.  The cheek of the matter is beyond words.   If you must by a Samsung product, buy it from a 3rd Party. They are not worth your time.

                I wish I could choose to give 0 stars.  Product quality is horrible.  I have owned the unit for 7 months.  I has broken 5 times resulting in puddles of water around the entire refrigerator and food spoilage on all occasions.  Their service center will not notify you of a time window until the day of the scheduled repair, but then they do not arrive in that window.  They call after the window of time has passed to say they will be another 2 hours late.  When you call their customer service center, they will not allow you to submit a complaint.  The warranty is from the date they manufactured the unit, not the date of purchase which effectively shortened my warranty by 5 months.  The goal of their horrible service and repeated delays seems to be making sure my warranty expires so they will not have to replace the unit.  Hour long phone calls to try to resolve the problem are ""not counted"" toward the number of problems that will lead to a replacement.  Do not buy a Samsung product.  Horrible quality and even worse service.  There is absolutely no concern for the customer.

                Bought a Samsung smart TV in Jan 2017.  Now Dec 2019 a vertical black line has appeared.  Contacted Samsung and gave them all the info they asked for including the registered guarantee ref no they gave me when I registered the tv.  The guarantee was an offer that if you register the product within 90 days of purchase, you will be eligible for a 5 year warranty.  They now say this does not exist and they don't know anything about this even though they are still advertising this on their website albeit not for TVs anymore.  TV is not fit for purpose with a fault like this.  After investigation, seems like this is a common fault.  Wish I knew this before I bought it.  Will now go down the Consumer Rights route to have it fixed.  Samsung are no help at all.  AVOID SAMSUNG TVs.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  If we all boycote Samsung, hopefully they will suffer from a drop in sales.

                Bought a Samsung Tab and realized it was the wrong size and wanted to exchange it.  Waited past the 15 days and they will not exchange or return.   Terrible policy especially around Christmas. I would never buy On Line again from them.

                Some 6 months ago i purchased a fridge-freezer (Model RB33N321NSS) from a generally well-reputed retailer, who requested Samsung to deliver it direct to me. 7 weeks ago the fan stopped blowing cold air from freezer to fridge. After long waiting periods on helpdesk phone to store, (one I had to give up on) and then visit the store, an assistant advised us to contact Samsung, as their responsibility ended after 30 days, so having had nightmare experiences over two days on their own 'helpdesk', waiting for long periods and not knowing whether anyone would pick up, the assistant made the call for me and i got asked a long list of questions to check whether i was the cause and not their product. (Frustration is not helped by having no free landline number to call and having to hold mobile to ear for long periods, plus signal problems and the frequent difficulty in understanding the agents' questions and instructions.)  Long story cut very short, i finally got an engineer's visit. He found a lump of solid ice around the fan and said he would get whole item replaced within a few days. Late following day they phoned to say Samsung were wanting another test done before they would agree to replace. Engineer added more refrigerant as requested as a temporary fix and I was informed again that a replacement fridge-freezer was now ordered and would be coming via a courier. Samsung meanwhile wanted to see the original sales Invoice as proof of purchase, but store do not deal with paper now, using just one code number that accesses all detail. Fortunately, by this time i had been put in touch with two helpful advisors at the store, who would help me liaise with the other 3 companies involved, and the local man found the till receipt on the system to email on to Samsung. Since then a head office case manager has been brilliant in liaising with Samsung and other companies, and getting the replacement to me, (after 2 failed delivery attempts) which hopefully will not develop the problem again. My advice would be to always check the retailer will supply 'Amazon-type' customer support in getting manufacturers to take notice of customers' complaints- beyond a few days after purchase. After all, we have bought the item from the store where it is displayed, not the manufacturer- with a certain amount of trust involved.  Also check that they provide adequate paperwork at time of sale, including clear printed warranty conditions. As can be seen from others' reports here too- it would not do to have flimsy, or no, store backup, dealing with replacements from Samsung. Unfortunately, without such backup support, I very much doubt I would have the replacement now. In fact AFTER 7 WEEKS WAITING, 2 letters to head offices, many phone calls, early poor helpline response, (after which store case manager took over), general lack of concern and competence, I would have been reduced to even more of a gibbering wreck by now, as health was deteriorating fast.

                I ordered two curved monitors (via Amazon) and the stand for one of them was not at the same angle as the other so the monitors were not aligned.  I contacted Samsung via their Live Chat Support and they agreed to replace the stand, which I received two days later. Very pleased with the service.

                If there’s a zero. I will give it. During thanks giving, I order 4 appliance. On the website, they offer 10% bundle discount in addition to the promotion price. But, when I place the order, the bundle discount disappeared. I didn’t notice until a week later. And their customer phone takes forever to connect. When I talked to their representative finally, they asked me to cancel thanksgiving order and place another one. But, no more promotion and my house project is delayed. They are not responsible for their website bug.

                Unfortunately SAMSUNG has the WORST customer service ever. I’ve been waiting for my refund for an item I returned since August 2019 now we are in December 2019 and haven’t gotten it every time I call them they tell me next week you’ll be receiving it since August they’ve been telling me that. I’m very disappointed I really hate Samsung now worst customer service they can’t deal with customers problems. I will never buy anything from Samsung.

                The Samsung Canada Customer Care and delivery team are the worst in the industry. Period. I bought an expensive 4K QLED television from Samsung Canada. The delivery driver reported the product as delivered when in fact it had not been delivered. In contrast, when I purchase a product online through Amazon, the delivery driver will leave a note on my door if I am not there to tell me where I can pick up the product. Most of the Customer Care staff were either rude or incompetent or both. Also, most of the staff do not speak English very well so I was surprised they would be given a job to speak on the phone with customers who are paying a lot of money to purchase the Samsung products. Do yourself a favor, save the hassle and aggravation, and shop elsewhere.

                I am never purchasing Samsung again, ever. Other companies offer comparable products with better customer service. The whole experience with them has been a total nightmare. And their products may be good but there are comparable competitors and they have better customer service.

                NEVER would I deal with thier customer service again! Constantly having to chase! Different person everytime! Extremely un helpful! Wanted me to wait in at home for 7 hours to wait for an engineer for a cosmetic issue! Apsolutly appauled with the way they deal with thier customers! I would not recommend calling them. I personally will be paying an engineer to come over and fix my samsung appliances!! AWEFUL company!!

                Avoid purchasing Samsung products, I purchased a tablet A brand new and had to send it back over a month due to a bulge appearing on the side of the tablet progressively getting worse. Making casing come away. I send this straight back as it was brand new and they have come back to me and said this was done due to Incorrect use of sim tray when removing even though it hasn't been touched as it's purely used with WiFi. so in a nutshell they shifted the blame they then went on to say   First Observations Device is in fair condition, powers up, not rooted, no accessories present for inspection.    Engineer Findings  LCD not cracked; Rear cover not cracked, slightly deformed due to incorrect sim tray removal process; No signs of dust/debris on tape. No signs of liquid or physical damage to PBA. No sign of liquid contamination/ingress on the sub-pba usb charging port of device LDI Not activated. No excessive overheating observed. Wired charging pulls correct current, however, the battery shows different percentage when is put to charging process due to a potential faulty battery.  The conclusion was they would fix the whole lot for me due to the faulty battery. But leaving a sour taste in my mouth as they tried to shift the blame to me. When I haven't touched the sim tray and the tablet has been boxed and well looked after . On to my next point the fact they say fair condition what does this mean there is not a single scratch on it what are they rating as fair ? This makes me worried that they class it as fair condition that I've got a below standard product? Im also now worried I've got a product with a fault that is now being refurbished and Sent back to me after 1 month . Awful in my eyes ?

                This is what you get when you contact Samsung support Hi all, We have bought a Samsung Galaxy S10e - and after few months you can hear a rattle coming from the inside of the device (close to top speaker on the device) so we have contacted Samsung for warranty repair. The pick up service Samsung offers is waste of time, have agreed a date for the phone to be picked up - but day before the pickup date at 5PM - I have received an email stating that my repair is booked for 2 weeks later - went to Samsung and asked why my date was moved - they said that they received an email before 5PM and no one actually bothered to let me know!!! And i only took a day off for this - no big deal! Phone was sent off (eventually) for repair and just came back - with the same rattle as it had before - went on Samsung website to get this sorted and was speaking with a advised that actually given me the number to people where the phone was repaired and I was told to get this sorted myself and he disconnected me - rude! (Cs rep name was Alphyne) Since Samsung has given me the middle finger I have phoned  people at Samsung repair and I was told that this rattle comes from a camera and its quite normal for those to be like that??? WHAT?? - even that I have said to them that we have had a look at another S10e and no rattle could be heard - and when we have bought the device no on made us aware that we are baying a most expensive ""rattle toy"" you could ever imagine and have been advised they wont look at this again. In the meantime I have received an apologetic letter from someone at Samsung but when I phoned back to get to the bottom of this - no one knew what I was talking about. Never again  Several users reporting this issue on various websites so I'm not the only one.

                I have been using Samsung phones last 5 years, Im happy with phone but whenever I have issues with phones, Samsung service made me upset. And they argue with customers, but Apple services never ever argue and try to solve the problem, Samsung service don't mind. Samsung head office must train Australiain Samsung services staffs.

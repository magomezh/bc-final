                If you need something for your kitchen or have some special affair, it's the people right for you anyway. How else do you keep going for them for basically any matter. We really need to keep them coming? Can we please do that or not?

                To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. I bought a brand new $80 Cuisinart coffee pot and it recently stopped working after somewhat infrequent use over a year (and a few months). <br/><br/>I contacted Cuisinart support and I have to say that the experience was horrible. I found out that I had to pay for shipping to have the new coffee pot sent to me AND I have to pay for shipping to send the cord from the old coffee pot back to them. <br/><br/>Rather than switching to a new brand immediately, I decided to give them a chance. I gave them my serial number, model number, and shipping information. <br/><br/>Skip forward to today. The new coffee pot arrived and they sent me the wrong color. Now I have a coffee pot that doesn't go with anything in my kitchen. AND, I STILL HAVE TO PAY THEM FOR THEIR ERROR! <br/><br/>I always thought of Cuisinart as a well known, well-trusted home brand. Apparently, that is no longer the case.

                I bought a kettle from this company, similar to one that had lasted many years, the new one has a glitch on the display, if set to 85 degrees it flashes 75C for a second or two, also it does not always turn off when boiling at 100C. The company said they would replace it with a later batch model, they didn't so the replacement had the same issues and then even though I sent a video of the issue they supposedly could not replicate the problem and were highly dismissive, i felt they thought I was lying.<br/><br/> They retuned the old kettle for some unknown reason with no protecting packaging loose in a box and and it was covered in scratches and dents, a weird practice and not great to be left being basically called a liar and seeing returns treated so badly. Avoid this company, they don't care at all and the kettle was over £70, and don't expect returns in a good condition, I binned mine it was that bad, not that it was needed. So I'm still stuck with a kettle with this issue still, well that's just great Cuisinart, thanks for nothing.

                People do not order from this company as they only send part off your Order. Don't contac you then have the cheek to tell you they won't refund your money.And not to mention there customer service . What a joke off a company has totally put me off to buy anything CUISiART.

                I purchased a countertop oven/ air fryer which failed during the warranty period. Cuisinart said that I had to return the old unit to claim the warranty. It cost $60.00 shipping to return this unit. They should inform customers of this prior to purchase.

                Got a US version of a Cuisinart coffee maker as a father days  present and after using it, needed spare parts. Initially a lot of confusion between Cuisinart US and UK and our request for help feel through gaps<br/><br/>However, when UK picked up on this, WOW, what a great service. Really helpful, very kind and in the end replaced the machine for us with no charge.<br/><br/>Brilliant service - will buy from them again

                I bought the Cuisinart Ice Cream and Gelato Professional.  It's just amazing, it's so easy to use too.  So far I've made vanilla ice cream, mango, cherry, peach, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, lemon and lime, banana, pineapple, chocolate orange, mint and chocolate chip, mandarin, toffee and baileys!<br/><br/>It was a bit pricey but well worth the money, I will never buy shop bought ice cream again! <br/><br/>The recipes are a good guide and I just adapted them to suit the flavours that I was creating. The recipes do say to use double cream, but I use the 'thicker double cream' and the results are perfect. With the baileys I think I used to much of it and the setting wasn't as good, but if you eat it quick enough then it's fine, it did give hubby and headache the next morning!<br/><br/>I did however have to buy lots of containers from Ikea and a new small chest freezer just to accommodate all the ice cream!<br/><br/>Well worth buying, I got mine from John Lewis and it's guaranteed for five years. I cannot fault this item.

                Appalling products from my experience.<br/>First Kettle leaked.<br/>Second kettle failed.<br/>Both within warranty.<br/>From my personal experience I recommend hat this company's products are avoided like the plague.

                Very very expensive poor customer service sandwich / Waffle maker / toaster handle breaks after only a year and this burns you as it’s normally  hot when shutting and snapping <br/>I have purchased 3 of them only for this to happen each time. After further investigation I found 50 other customers with same complaints <br/>Maybe this is something they should redesign but honestly this product is not long life if no proof of purchase they offer a new one with a discount so you can burn yourself again lol so be warned!!

                After trying George Foreman, Russell Hobbs etc. etc. all failed on design and difficulty keeping clean. The Cuisinart grill was a bit more expensive but well worth it, design is brilliant can use opened out to form two hot plates, plates are reversible for grill or griddle cooking. They are also removable for easy clean or dishwasher. Drip tray is huge and easy to empty and is integral to machine so always in position to catch drips. Two controls with various heat settings...only cringe is drain off into drip tray is very small and tends to get blocked not a big issue.<br/>Would recommend for any kitchen, I bought mine from John Lewis at a competitive price.

                After trying to make a purchase, I found several bad reviews here and on other sites for the cuisinart web store.  Came to realize that my order placed on the cuisinart site got me a order confirmation from the web store.  Then noticed that pricing, products, contact information, etc is all the same, so it is actually just their outlet.     Granted, I am spoiled by Amazon and their speed and quality, but my experience so far was - Order placed last week tuesday.  Email confirmation on wednesday morning that the order was received.  It's cookie season so I paid for 2 day shipping to get my replacement blade quickly.  Friday rolls around, no tracking number or any other word.  I try to call customer service and after 15 minutes on hold give up. Send an email, and get the we will get back to you in 24 to 48 hours  response.   Monday rolls around, still no response. So now it's coming up on a week, and still nothing.     Then I figured out the whole shenanigans of the two sites being related.  Found a bunch of online reviews complaining about slow shipping, no shipping, wrong items shipped, and poor customer service.   So, decide to just cancel the orders.  Just got off the phone with customer service (this time it only took 12 minutes on hold).  It's a telling statement when I say I have to cancel an order, and they just respond with what's the number, and ok you're all set.  They must get that request a lot if there's not even a question about why or what the issue was, and what they could do to fix the situation.   Looks like I will be buying another food processor instead of fixing it, and you can bet it won't be a Cuisinart.
